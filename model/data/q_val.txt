mrnamessenger rnatrnatransfer rnarrnaribose rna
when her aunt asked her if she feels weighed down by what she has to do for her family
first the amount of vinegar would be needed
when do you pour the vinegar in the containers
the author organized the article in an explaining order
what kinds of mass should be added in so that can cause confusion
with a little training we can do whatever
a plastic type b was the stretchiest and plastic type a was least stretchiest
he asked why didnt you tell me about this
passive uses no energy to move proteins across a cell membrane
diffusion moves substances from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration
the cell nucleus controls what goes in and out of the cell as well
one trait i can think of would be unsure of herself
it makes paul quizical as to why a record breaking runner was a hall monitor in his school
i feel asleep working on my essay rose said
we need to know what the samples are in the procedure it just says to get four samples
the author organizes the article in four basic tones
a plastic type b is the one that has the most length
however when paul learns mr leonard is illiterate he feels sympathetic because they have a common condition
space junk should not be considered a minor matter
the process would be translation or transcription
so that is how the author organizes this well written article
this would have made the experiment more conclusive
there different from pythons because they cant eat almost anything like a python
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they are both specialists species
when speaking to rose she does not tell her that she also feels hopeless about their situation
the second trail the first two numbers are higher then the two in the first trail
the by giving the article different sections with different names graps more attention
it mutiplies really fast and then makes more and more of what is needed
i would need these pieces of information so i can repeat this experiment
the second section what is space junk
rose conversations were based on there trait there are all from cambodia
rose does not like to burden others with her own problems
the cell uses different types of proteins such as transport protein to decide what comes in or out
one trait is her way to deel with pain or emotions
in order to run this experiment i would need to know what samples are being tested
mr leonard and paul shared that they both have trouble reading in school and need help to be successful
the backrground information that paul finds out about mr leonard has a good effect on him
the four major steps interphase telophase anaphase and prophase
talking about the first launch and the space race in the cold war
cell membranes let go of waste eat and engulf food and can block bad stuff from getting in
it includes headings with short paragraghes under them
they do not come in contact with one another
the author then gives a breif history on space junk
mr leonard helps to push paul on and off the track to perform well and try hard
the control of the expiriment was the actions of the vinegar in the water that affacted the samples
mr leonard didnt have learning centers paul realized how blessed he really was
in paragraph they explaine about invasive species is unfair
also they are different because pandas and koalas eat plants and pythons eat animals
she seems like an optimist because she doesnt get angry about her dad like anna does
they give more facts and number that we can not ignore
paul is lucky to have a coach like mrleonard
another is to let the clam hang for minutes
one proses is called cell movement that is where the cell is moved thrue the cell by the organells
the author also labeled the paragraphs with specific titles that forshadowed what you was going to be reading next
paul seem intrested in what had happened
a cell has flalgia that are finger like projections allowing it to move
one process used by cells to control the movement of substances is mitosis which splits the cells
the author organize the article by using subheading and a strong intro
he was confused about why mr leonard didnt tell him and why he kept his past a secret
the final step is that new proteins are made
i could tell that she was up set with the way that things were happening to her
another process is the fission where the substances go through a hole in the membrane
white darker colors usually attract more light
as you can see in the data table plastic type b stretched mm in the st trial
then secondly get the protien out of it
the author organizes the article by first introducing the topic and that it poses a threat
mrna arrives and leaves the sequence from the dna
i think the reason is her aunt kolab seems to help people see the good in life
mr leonard trained paul so now paul wants to train mr leonard to read
i need to pour on each of pour seperate but dentical containers
rose tries and cheers her up and looks on the positive side of things
one trait that describes rose is hopeless
we would also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each cup
it also show how people can help other people
this conclusion was reached by their adaptability to multiple environments and disrupting the ecosystems
diffusion is another way cells get in and out of the cells
the author starts on a somewhat fast pace trying to grab the readers attention
the could have one add more info to the procedure and state why they are doing this experiment for
translation deletion translocation transformation
then it follows into telling the readers a breif history passage about spacecraft
the next paragraph is called crash course which tells us what the space junk has caused in space
paul is amazed at mr leonard when he finds out of his acomplishments as a runner
vesicules transport the protein to where it needs to be
so it just showed paul that he shouldnt give up just because something gets hard in life
she is not happy about her dad having to leave for a job in los angeles
she has a temper when talking with anna
mr leonard background informatiosn makes paul feel bad for him
three ways to do this are active passive and diffusion
the trna transports the codons to the mitochondrion
black so the dog will stay warm at night
she talked to anna about they had a part to do so that they could go to college
as the article states in paragraph the snakes have imperiled endangered species in the florida keys
lastly heshe explains why it is a big deal to many people why space junk is dangerous
the procedure simply refers to these unknown substances as samples or materials
another one is that the cell has cytoplasm that holds all the things together in the cell
the four major steps involved in protein synthesis are
the word invasive when the tain approving bear in the article
white would reflect the light and not heat up t he doghouse as much as any other color
it also has a gate to keep unwanted molecules out
secondly they should have more than two trials to improve the validity of the results
rose seems to be a very kind and caring person and wants to help other people
paul learns to be kind and help someone that helped him
the pet industry says that million homes now own reptiles
protein transport helps bring enzymes into the cell
plastic type a stretched the least with mm on t and mm on t
rose always seems negative with no hope
the mrna makes another copy of itsself making trna
paul could have helped mrleonard become better at reading during the same time paul was training for huddling
first he captures your interest with his rhetorical question its atool bag
in the passage she tells her sister things that she may not wan na hear
it moves by the force of the enxymes across the cell membrane
mrna then sends its message to the nuclear membrane to creat certain dna codes for it
according to the students results type b plastic was longer in length and stretchable
this is why invasive is a significant word
the additional information that would be needed is the starting mass the ending and the difference
second it doesnt state what are the samples like what rocks they are
they can only live in these places because they need what is grown there
the trna comes and attaches to the mrna to begin protein synthesis
no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read
the ligh ter the color the cooler it will be inside
after hours remove the samples from the containers and allow it to dry
once at the rrna the instructions go through translation which result in a new protein
in the fourth to fifth paragraph she explains what the space junk is and what it means for us
the last step is that it comes back together
pandas in china and koalas in australia are similar because they are specialists and only eat one food
the aliens will then disrupt the biodiversity if it is not held under control
a python though doesnt need as specific of living arrangnents besides a warm climate
once the mrna finds the ribosome the aug codon starts the protein synthesis
black white would keep the doghouse the coldest ar ound
one trait to describe rose would be optimistic
transports information throughout the body
also i would need to know what material to put in each container
they became the light that had illuminated the stage att pauls high school graduation
osmosis diffusion and active transport
a trait that rose showed when she was talking to anna was that she can be sarcastic
they can eat a rat birds etc whole and they get digested
the mrna copies the anti codons from the dna and transports it through the cytoplasm
mr leonard was a good athelete and couldnt read
rose respects her elderes and doesnt want to hurt their feelings
the word invaisive is significant to this article
it was mm in the first trial in the second trial it stretched more millimeter
and third the transportation of nutieants to the body and other cells that need it
she is explaining to anna that maybe one day they will have it good
mr leonard responce was i was a good athlete but not a good student
the author organizes the article by putting them into subgroups
every weight they add should be the same
and probably her aunt would tell her mother
you need to know how much vinegar to add to the containers
in the story rose is a very giving person
this is important because it talks about one main important moment when space junk really became a problem
rose didnt answer the question because she felt she would hurt her aunts feelings
this in turn causes her to have a dream of being trapped in the water by her older brother
paul realized mr leonard was like him in many ways
they are both different from pythons because they dont eat meet
rose seems to have many traits in this story
one type of movement control is passive transportation
first i would need to know what samples i am using in order to find their mass
prophase metaphase anaphase and telophase
the additional infomation you would need to replicate the experiment would include the size of the samples
also they need to include what the four samples are in the procedure and how big they are
in this experiment students tested to see
he flunked out of a collage that he got a track scholarship for
paul realizes that he and mr leonard actually have a lot in common
the step before step should be to collect all the samples
in the experiment the black lid made the air the hottest
paul pointed to the picture and asked mr leonard about it
they have a section titled what is space junk
it opens up a new world for paul is what im saying overall
they could improve their validity by doing three trials instead of two
in crash course the author is talking about the dangers of satellites colliding with each other
prophase metaphase anaphase and telephase
all the other sections follow a similar suit
when paul finds out that mr leonard was a runner also he is very surprised
lastly that you need to find the difference between the starting and ending mass
paul learns that mr leonard is not vary smart
the author procedes with one idea at a time describing was space debris is
this would definitely improve the validity of their results
after mrna leaves the nucleus the codons are translated to trna and are translated into dna
other ways they can improve their experiment is by adding the same amount of weights at each type
it also gives an example of two satellites colliding with one another and spreading tiny debris all over space
the one and only trait that i think could describe rose is motivation
after the mrna leaves the nucleus it goes through the cytoplasm and hooks onto a ribosome
it is a lesson to make school a priority of track
the rrna has the trna transfer this code into a set code for a new protein
the author organized the article by geological events
she also tried to calm her sister when she felt bad about her father being away
movement requires the cell to adapt to different places in the cell
the group should have told the reader how much vinegar to put in the container
then after it leaves the nucleus it enters the cytoplasm
thus creation another amino acid and the amino acids are held together in a chain by peptide bonds
the information about mr leonard led to paul succeeding in hurdles and able to be on the track team
this would help the dog stay warmer in the winter
they are both different from pythons because pythons eat meat living things and pandas koalas dont
the mrna feeds the code through the rrna
once the message is received the rrna performs the functionthen it repeats starting back with the mrna
if placed indoors the color may not matter because indoors is usually warm
then the next section explains what space junk is
that makes me think that she is emberassed
they showed through out the article that these creatures are dangerous
decodes ittakes it to trnatrna takes it to the ribosomesribosomes make protiens
the author organizes the artical into one over all topic which is the introduction and three sub topics
only if you already have verything rose said
i would also have to know how much vinegar to pour into each container
you were a college freshman who won the meter hurdles at the nationals
the color white dosnt absorb as much heat as the other colors do
pandas are similar to koalas because they are both bears and have similar diets
the author wants the reader to comprehend the amount of space junk in space
you have to use the condon to find where you start at
also koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost all the time unlike pythons
during the story the reader gets information about mr leonards track records
also i think they should have one more trials
they should include the temp and how mutch vinegar
convergent evolution divergent evolution
the author wants the reader to not be confused
also step should be switched with step
difffusion osmosis and protein carriers
the cell membrane decides if the items can pass through the cell or not
both were investigated at the same time
he later dropped out because no college wanted a athlete that wasnt able to read
then the author talks about how in space its really not that safe
paul is effected by the backround information because what he learns he can really relate too
pythons dont belong here in the united states
the author starts off the passage with a comical line grab your telescope
crash course little bits but a bing deal
also exocytosis is used by cells to get certain materials to leave the cell
the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here
in conclusion to this data i think plastic type b is the most flexible type of plastic
paul knows with a lot of effort and continued practice he can be a decent track and feild athlete
after the mrna leaves the nucleus it travels through the cytoplasm
the background on mr leonard has a great effect on paul
inably what was need to determine ble mass of the samples
the trna then builds up into amino acids that link together to become a protein
paul even statesthe emotion in mrleonards words were all to familiar to me
the panda and koalas eat resources people need
it copies itself then it translates then it transcripts
dna uses the intructions to build genteic code
mr leanard was a hall monator in middle school
rose see it as family is way more important than anything
the one trait i depicted from this passage was that rose is grown up
next you would need to know the size of the marble because different sizes might each erato faster
another way to control the movement is by diffusion
the author puts all the main points as his title
lastly i would want to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample with
based on the students data plastic type b stretched the farthest and therefor has the most stretchability
he flunked out of college because is his disablilty to read
the author organizes the article by headlines
when paul recieved the background information he had questions for mr leonard
then he uses sub headings for the next paragraphs
this shows she is atleast giving it a shot
invasive means that other animal or organism takes control over someone or something
describes what space junk is and how it negatively affects the environment
she also mentions to anna how her father has to work hard to send paul to college
after reading the groups procedure i was left wondering what are the four different samples they are pouring
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they are both plant eaters and are becoming extinct
also there should be more specific size measurements of the containar
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers
the information gives paul motivation to never give up on school or athletics
pandas and koalas are specialist animals meaning basically they rely on their environment to survive
also i would need to kno how much vinegar is needed
they also couldve written the amount of weight that was stretching the plastics
this is only a few posible ways that cells could control the movement of substances across the cell membrane
trna transfers cells mrna messangerrrnagrna
paul was surprised to fing out that mr leonard cant read
however aunt kolab is very understanding and talks through the situation with her niece
every week mr leonard asked the same question where are you going
while getting copied they split in half and those halves get identical matchers
so it seems rose may have to step up and help out
mr leonard had troubles in highschool just like paul does
cells also use marker proteins so other cells can read where they are needed to do a job
paul was surprised to find out that mr leonard had at one time run track
they go to where their function is needed
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
then in the second paragraph he talks about what space junk is and how it comes to be
four major steps arethem forming things around themthey work togetherthey
the effect that the background information had on paul was shock
in the article she says he had to go
their only food source is where they live
for example in the section crash course there is a detailed explanation of how two satellites collided in
it goes to describe the diffrent types of debris and how they become lost on our atmosphere
and there are two paragraphs in that section
for example this student said take a sample of one type instead she cold have said whch one
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances acrosss the cell membrane are
then he to a serious point where the author starts explaining about space junk
the invasive was species undergo a lag before proliferating
to replicate the experiment i would have to know the size of its containers i use
it has facts backing up theyre statements
its very vague so they should add more specific
i think that this helps paul realize that he could be good at something too
the walls of her room were bathed in pale sunlight
prophaseanaphasemetaphasewhere the cells begins to splitinterphase
even thou she is just a child she thinks as an adult
why are they trying to get the mass of the elements listed in the table
he wanted to show respect and help mr leonard do something too
the author uses an attentiongetter at the beggining of the article to draw readers in
pandas in china only eat bamboo which is only found in certain asian countrys
energystores foodprotects the cell and foodhelps it stay alive
also other info would be what size containers do you need for this experiment
but paul also realized that him and mr leonard had a lot in common and it inspired him
when mr leonard told paul about his background history paul could relate
the author starts out drawing the reader into the article
one trait that can describe rose would be concern
the author organizes the article by seperating different topics into different sections
they also never listed the materials that needed to be used
that the containers were stored at for hours
one piece of information needed would be what samples to use as it is not indicated in the procedure
you would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup
pandas eat bamboo while koalas eat eucalyptus leaves
however on the other hand this experiment is nt closley applicable
state how long you are rising the materials in water
the reason the procedure is bad because they did not finish
during the story paul does not know much about mr leonard
trna transfers it which makes a protein
also a total of the data could have been better too
plastic type b was the strechiest plastic streching mm in t and mm in t
he takes it in different step in explaining his ideas for the purpose he trying to make
invasive could mean a variety of things in this article expecially endangered
diffusion liquid slowly spreads solid through liquid until its spread out evenly ex
it stretchedmm and the second trial it stretched mm
this information on mrleonard makes paul wonder why mrleonard didnt finish college
he had to leave because he needed to raise money for the family
paul was surprised and when he confronted mr leonard about it wanted to know why he had quit
the author organizes this article by starting it off with an interesting scenario
also they should do another trial and then average out the results
they should have specified the mass of the weights used
he seemed proud of him that he had accomplished something so great and had something to his name
that amino acid creates the necessary protein
the author organizes this article into the past the current and our future lives
it makes paul feel sorry for him and then teach him how to read
paul and mr leonard have had very similar childhoods
rose is dismissive and a little passive
the author uses historical information and informative information to get his point across
instead of hurting her aunt and mother she kept it to herself
carries instructions from the nucleus to the amino acids sequence of a protein
these amino acids are then joined together in the sequence ordered by the mrna
the half of the mrna gets copied and is sent to the new nucleus
rose is a very positive person and is the oldest of her sister anna
and pandas and koalas eat bamboo and eucalyptus leaves
the mrna leaves the cell cell makes protienmrna bings it back cell uses it
the significance of this word invasive is that it is throughout the whole story
the student could have included how much the weights weighed
rose didnt want to hurt aunt kolab or make her feel bad
rose is the kind of person that is very straight forward bout things
for example pandas eat nothing but bamboo and koalas eat nothing but eucalyptus leaves
the author starts out gentle and says the facts straight out
they often have many different ways to move things
all of these additional information would be needed in order to replicate the experiment
paul learns that mr leonard was a poor reader just as paul is
the author organizes the articles in a way that will make it easiest for us to understand
the cytoplasm helps to hold all of the organells and helps things to move
she doesnt seem like one to get angry with people very easily
staying up late working on school work to get in finished for the next day
pythons are diffrent because they are a generalist species
her not telling the truth to her aunt shows that she is very conserned on other peoples feelings
the beginning is a introduction or attention grabber to get you ready to read the reportstory
it controls the blood going through your veinsit filters the waist productsit helps the blood count
the essay she has to get done for the state competition is making her feel exhausted and moody
pandas eat bamboo which is predominatly found in china
in the story mr leonard helps paul become a good athlete after learning that he cant read
for plastic type a the amount stretched increased by one mm
thats why a black doghouse is b est for a doghouse to keep the dog warm
i can not draw a conclusion because important information is missing from the table
we would also need to know how much vinegar in ml to pour in the cups
pandas in china and koala in australia are similar because they are both specialists
you would need to know how much of each substance was used in order to replicate the experiment
twice a week he visits mr leonard the hall monitor
paul was astonished at the fact that mr leonard would not tell him about such an amazing achomplishment
according to the students data plastic type b is the strongest
after hour remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water
the given procedure doesnt tell the location so you need to know the location of the containers
which explains whats happen over the past years
there are millions of cells in your body working to fight iff infectioncells help keep you healthy
also it makes paul have empathy for mr leonard
he organize it by putting it in a order where you would understand it better
she is very smart and knows what she is talking about
these animals are different from the python because the python is a generalist animal
in the crll there is a cell membrane a cell wall and protens
the student should have done another trial and have a control group
reapent with remaining placing a striges sample into a single container
one piece of additional information needed in the procedure would be how much vinegar to pour in the container
in active transport substances move from areas of a low concentration to areas of a high concentration
in the introduction the author grabs the reader by making surprising statements
they should also mention how much vinegar to pour on each sample to have the same effect
also the student could have named the type of plastics
as for the koala and panda they eat certain type of food that can only found in that habitat
it makes paul think how far he has gotten and how much help he recieved
the third process is trna or transfer rna which transfers the message to the specific orgnelle
in the article it says that even the term
paul then realizes what he could do for mr l
diffusion the golgi and the rough endoplasmic reticulum
then with what happens with all this junk and if it carshes
the dream in which paul sinks like a rock on top her supports my answer
the lysomoes are what helps to keep it in the nucleus
peptide bonds are formed between the amino acids after translation has occured
they dont say what we use or how to find the mass of the samples
first of all in order to replicate this experiment you need to know what the materials are
rose asks her younger sister anna whats wrong and if she is feeling okay
from the stroy paul has a reading disablility and has a hard time reading
telling him cmon mr leonard as they walked back towards the school
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
when paul learns that mr leonard was a track star he wonders why he isnt anymore
at the end of the story paul wants to help mr leonard out by helping him read
one trait that can describe rose is stress
codons come and break the rnas code down three at a time
she is writing an essay for the state competition
i think that when someone puts someone elses feelings or thoughts before their own is a careing person
thats why i think that what paul found out about mr leonard effects
you would need to know the list of materials to have everything to complete your experiment
a generalist is a raccoon a python achabach
finally the group did not say the size of the container
it thens to made intop protein and then it goes into protein synthesis
they re differt from pythons because theyre not as popular as pythons
they are also similar because they only eat one kind of specific food
things such as temperature are necessary
suddenly i realized what i could do for him
coming to a solution the white p aint would be the best to use for a dog house
dark gray has trials that are deg c which is hot
the dark grey average temperature after minutes was deg
in paragraph mr leonard ask paul what was his name so paul though that the was rare
spread out and collect the cells go through the cell cycle
rose says only if you have everything
the author organizes it by putting it into four different sections each explaining a different part about space
active transport helps with the flow of water in the membrane
mrna leaves the nucleus and carries to the mitochondria
heshe also could have recorded the original lengths of each of the plastics heshe was measuring
the are both different from pythons because there specialist and the python is a generalist
before they were endangered but now they arent
diffusion continues until the membrane has obtained equillibrium on both sides
although she has a heavy load on her shoulders she does not take her stress out on others
then he uses the heading crash course to talk about the different crashes between freeorbting satelites in the past
the backgroung information affected paul by letting him know mr leonard cant read too
rose said we have our part to do to help paul finish college
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they both require special native food
it will then pull apart than start all over again
no school would take a runner who couldnt read
the cells us enzymes amino acids and chromosomes
paul also wanted to know why he kept it from him
the author organizes this article by using an introduction first and then three sections what is space junk
they also should have included the size of the plastic samples
she is sad due to all the events that have occured in her life recently
the data table shows the temperature throu gh a three way trial
mrna gose to the binding site with the insturtctions for building the protien
plastic stretched the most it had stretched mm and mm
when paul first discovers the shocking new information on mr leonard he is a bit confused
the author organizes the artice by putting the information into three different sections
first the mrna must identify the protein needed for protein synthesis
i would also need to know what sample goes in each container
black this color will make the inside of the doghouse warmer than the other colors
prophase metaphase anaphase and telephase
the significance of the word invasive is it can be used as a powerful word
to replicate this lab you would need the samples to be the same masses
one trait that rose has shown is hopefulness
white white dosnt obsorb light how ever black dose
second it opnes the wall to the accepted substance
when rose talks with aunt kalob she listens to what she has to say
they could have improved validity by adding another trial
they have no arms or legs theyre predators and etc
paul now understands why mrleonard wanted to help paul be on the track team
although the samples are shown in the table they are not expressed in the procedure
after school she goes to work then she goes home to help her aunt cook dinner
the cell also uses protein synthesis to move proteins around the cell
rna has to fit into holes where dna can not to make protein synthesis
the trna then tanslates the codons which then attaches the correct amino acid to the trna
dark gray it might affect the dog house a little
that talks about the american and russian satellites crashing and leaving debris all over its newly created orbital path
the authors tone is a big attention grabber at the beginning
in the article it says that pandas only eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves
the article said that invasive is passing judgement
it gives you backround information so you can get to understand the characters more to really feel the strory
starts with a question than he gives the reader lots of information
also the ribsomes help keep them moving
this is and example from the story as to the trait i described
it helps you grow strongh bones so when you get older you can lift heavy objects
a hypothesis was needed in this experiment
rose displays an outward optimism in her conversation with her younger sister anna
also she is respectfull of others and their pesonal opinions
it seems like hes been gone for years
then he goes on to explain what space junk is and how it is formed
one of the three proccesses is when the cells travel through the blood flow
after all would you want your dog to be uncomfortable on a hot summer day
active transport diffusion passive transport
your going to need how much is there in total
in the story gifts paul has trouble reading
the other process is when the ribosomes takes the substances out
passive transport used to move substances through the membrane without using energy
based on the students results the plastic with the most stretchability is plastic b
he feels that problem is increasing and if he doesnt do nothing about it will get worse
they specify to one type of substance that is crucial to their survival that without they could possibility die
she tries to make sure her sister is okay in paragraph
invasive is a word meaning clustered in one area
one trait that can describe rose is determination
they could have made this environment better by telling all this you what the plastics were
third starting mass was marble g ending mass at g and difference in mass g
the mrna leaves the nucleus to begin protein synthesis
he wants paul to become a good student first
the author starts by explaining to us about the concern of space junk
he could identify with the embarrassment he felt
then he gives a lot of statistcs and facts
you would need the size of the container amount of vinegar used the types of samples
they then move into an intoduction to the space race and what space junk is
