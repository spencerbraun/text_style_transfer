the student should list what rock is better and what rock is the worse in the procedure
an additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment
then your finally going to see the difference between those samples
i will organize the data to see if the information is accurate
in order to replicate this experiment i would need a scare in order to get the mass
next i would need tape and markers to label the containers
last i would need all samples and graduated cylinders as a container to replicate this experiment
you would need to have four seperate but identical containers
and new items would be needed to be placed in each of the containers
the students data needed to include how much of the solution was poored
they also needed to find out if the rocks weighed the same when they started
get different samples marble limestone wood plastic
put each sample into different containers
pour vinegar in each of separate but identical containers
after hrs remove the samples from the container and rinse each w distilled water
allow samples to sit and dry for min
you will need a timer to determine the time that the vinegar dryed up
there could be more than test for each sample
there could also have a constant added to the expariement
in the experiment i would determine the mas of each sample pair the vinegar into a container then label
i would wait hours then pour out the vinegar and nose out with water
let the samples dry and find the mass difference
calculate the time diffrence it took to prepare them
we have to know the starting mass the ending mass and the difference in mass
what the group of students did was determine the mass of different samples
the independent varriable is the imarble limestone wood plasticthe marble starting point was g
for each box they should have done it times so they would have an average
in order to replicate this this experiment youwould need the starting mass ending mass and difference in mass
your going to need how much is there in total
also a total of the data could have been better too
allow the samples to sit and dry for minutes
instead of putting determine the mass of each sample
i would tell you the outcome on what happened and how the experiment turned out
i will need to add on them subtena by how many number their are
the sample has the amount of four layers it is to divide by eight
the students should have made a hypothesis of what they thought was going to happen
also they should have stated what they were investigating
they should have made a conclusion from the results
to replicate the group experiment you would need to add information even as if the lab is valid
some additional information would be how much of each sample would be put into the vinegar
also maybe not have then sit for hours but hav then sit less
they could also have rinsed them with replica water instead of distilled water
you should repeat each step in the experiment
start with step and go all the way to step
we would need observations during the whole experiment maybe repeats of the experiment to see if anythings changed
in this groups procedure some additional information shouldve been what were the labels named
you would need more marble limestone wood and plastic
i dont know what replicate means so i dont know how to anser this question
after hours rinse the solutions off and weigh the mass again
the students still need to make a hypothesis a graph and find the difference in mass
in order to rept this experiment they could have multiple trial
determine the ending mass determine the difference in mass
also the mass or everything marble limestone wood and plastic
i would follow the procedure step by step
you would need to add observations you would also need to add the time on the table
you would also need to know what substance is also mixed in with the vinegar
place the materials into the containers and wait hours
may be the mass will be differet may be it will be the same
i guess follow the steps to make the experiment is risht like allow to dry in min
let it be separate with the vinegar the little containers
go over to make sure nothing goes wrong
say what you are trying figure out in the first place
some information i would need to know is how would the water be if
in order to complete the experiment you would need to know each temp
by hour bic its recorded after a har period
you would also need to know the mass before it was left to ary for mins
you will need more mass and you have to dry it for minutes
after hours remove the samples from the containers and note each sample with distilled water
you will probably need more of a little bit of everything
to replicate this experiment additional information you would need is a time chart to keep track of time
after the hours is over remove samples and rinse
have the samples sit and dry for min
the information the students left out was the control
the control of the expiriment was the actions of the vinegar in the water that affacted the samples
after reading this procedure i think it would need task needed
tell what it is you are doing and what solution and a hypothesis
more information is needed more steps because its not enough to direw a conclusion
the additional information you need to replace the experiment
you need limestone wood and plastic marbles
you test all of them in different containers
it will give you the mass of the experiment
that is what it need to replace the experiment
how much of the material did they put into each container
was there a controlled part of this experiment
did they conduct a graph for this experiment
to replicate this experiment you would need to add what scale weight rocks with
i believe that in order to replicate we would need the design of the experiment and when we
to replicate their experiment i would need to have take their their procedure and use them
i would also need their samples from their procedure and then be capable to copy their experiment
additional information would be doing the experiment times before putting the data down
also backround information is important to any experiment
after you determine the mass of the products go back and see of your thesey was correct
then go and daght a lab report about qv
more you could repete the expierement just see it
the limestone have mass than all of them
after hour remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water
they also should state to use the same mass objects so that it is easy to replicate
finally the group should use a control to compare their results to and for replication of the experiment
then you would say that limestone loses the most mass and wood lose the least mass
a hypothesis was needed in this experiment
also the group should had told the reader what was happening why the experiment was taking place
also they should had repeated the steps at least three times to make sure the results where accurate
maybe have have to samples sit and dry for more than mins
they need to repeat every step that already preformed
it is neccessary to know how the samples were rinsed w distilled water use
what was the purpose for them doing this experiment
it doesnt tell you what they are trying to figure out with the investigation
you should in all procedures out in an actually experiments
they should have said how much of each sample they put in each containor
one thing they should do is explain why they are testing viniger
where do you place the vinegar and where does the marble go in the experiment
also i think they should have one more trials
the information that is needed is the starting and ending mass
also you can try doing the experiement for a shorter or longer amount of time to get better results
last you can let the samples dry longer to see what happens to them
well you would need samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water
three pieces of information limestone plastic marble
pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers
repeat with remaining samples placing a hours remove the samples from placing a singl
what material did you use to get this answer
what effects did it have on all material such as color and size
why they even did it is in the first place
and what am i wanting to replicate the experiment and also where would i get the supplies i needed
and if theres anything that i shouldnt use in this experiment
i would have to check the mass of four different samples
put vinegar in each one of the separate containers
after reading the groups procedure the group should add a hypothesis controll and objective
pour vinegar in each of four peparate but identical containers
after hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water
allow the samples to sit and dry for minutes
to replicate the experiment i would need to know what the students goal was
i always label how much of an amount to put into a container
in their procedure its that the students did not do this
first off you would need more samples of the rocks to put in the rain
the person replicating it would also have to wait a whole other hours
more water and vinegar would be needed too
they provide you with all the information you need
they tell the procedure and they give you the data and they make a chart
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what the students are looking for
why each steps of the procedure is being done
after you remove the containers you rinse them see what results you get in about so minutes
i would need to know what was happening to the samples during that hrs
i would need to know why they chose the four samples that they did
i would also need gloves and a mask to protect myself
to replicate the experiments you will need all the samples and how you will need more acid rain
but i would make it clear so other people can easily do it to
then i would write a conclusion why this prblly happened
you will need a solution results and a conclusion
repeat with with remaining samples placing a single sample into a container
after hours remove the samples and allow samples to sit and dry
the additional information that would be needed is the starting mass the ending and the difference
you would need to add the type of solution the stones on goingin
the additional information you would needs wch one was the best marble limestonewood and plastic
this experiment should include an explanation of why students were doing this experiment
they should tell us why the mass decrease and why the wood keep the same mass
they also should watch how all the samples change and take notes
see if any of them dry slower then others or faster and why might they
in order to replicate the experiment you should measure the amount of vinegar added in each container
you should also measure the mass of each sample before adding them to the vinegar
lastly you should measure the amount of vinegar left after the material is taken out
the items are marble limestone wood and plastic
then write all the numbers down to replicate the experiment
i will need to add the vinegar in each of four separate and
the additional information i would add would be to record the data at the end of the procedure
to find the difference in the objects that were placed in the container
last the procedure doesnt include a clear purpose why are they doing this experiment
is it nessecary what varaety do they receive from this
thats how i would replicate the experiment
lastly that you need to find the difference between the starting and ending mass
bin they didnt just try a plain trial with other things to see if it effected the ending mass
limestone has the highest starting mass then come wood marble and plastic so this investigation is complete
after reading their procedure i dont even know what they are trying to do
i would add how many times to measure the mass and when to or now as well
you would need to give information on what the experiment is about
the first thing thing they did wrong was they didnt explain what their objective and investigation was about
also they didnt compare any data and talk about the difference in the mass
they got information but it did not have any mention to it
need an exeirimental desier staldhs the hypothics title and iv and ov
the sample is marble starting mass ending mass and difference in mass
the limestone sample starting mass ending mass difference
you would need the weight of the samples to see how much everything weighed
before weighing starting mass weigh each container alone then with the samples
you have to minus the ending mass from the starting mass
you may also need to know that they were soaked in vinegar for hours
the first starting mass was for wood g ending mass g and difference in mass g
second was limestone with starting mass g ending mass g difference g
third starting mass was marble g ending mass at g and difference in mass g
last was plastic starting mass g ending mass g difference g
i would need the procedure the samples starting mass ending mass and difference in mass
place marble limestone wood and plastic into separate containers
let them sit for hours and remove them after and rinse them with distilled water
allow the samples to dry for minutes
if the experiment was for an hour it would double
this table is not so clear it only has the dependent variables
the indepent variable is the change in mass
the purpose of this experiment was to see the different mass for four different samples
you would need the starting mass ending mass and difference in mass
by showing all the data then youll be able to replicate the experiment
i would need to determine the mass of four different samples
i would have to do the mass of grams for the samples
make sure to include at least three pieces of information
samples have lost in for mation because iget information
sample allow the samples to fit and dry for minutes
some additional information that would be need with this experiment is a hypothesis
this is because you should predict and guess the things you could be working with
you would also need a scale to tell you how much each sample range in grams
in order to replicate the experiment you will need to know why are the students making this experiment
why are they trying to get the mass of the elements listed in the table
in order to replicate the experiment is to have more samples time and containers
so you can use different sample different results of the mass in all objects
in the information they talk about all the procedures that the students did on there experiment
the students listed everything but they didnt give us the time they started
so you will know when to start the hours
so you can drain them and let them come out
you would need what the outcome is after the hours
label what liquid you used for this lab
to replicate the experiment you will need determine the mass of four diffrent samples
i dont think i would add any additional information the procedure seems pretty straight forward and very informational
determine the mass of four different samples
instead of pouring vinegar pour a different kind of liquid
use three different kind of containers to see what happens
after hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water
allow the samples to sit and dry for min
an explanation of why the amount of mass was that amount
one piece of information i would want to know is how big each piece of rock plastics wood
you must put some in four containers then place a sample of one material into one container and label
then after hours rinse each sample with water
after that let them dry and determine the mass of each sample
when do you pour the vinegar in the containers
i would also need samples of marblelimestoneswood and plastic
you would also need the total of all the samples
make sure they start with the same mass
in order to replicate the experiment you would need four samples
the sample materials should be marble limestone wood and plastic
also you would need vinegar to pour into the containers which hold the four different samples
first additional information would be to measure the starting mass of each sample before step
then after step find the difference in mass of each sample
the step before step should be to collect all the samples
those pieces of information you need to replicate this experiment are from the samples in hours
finally determine the mass of each example
what type of marble limestone wood and plastic did they used
need to follow the procedure also need to know them too
what you would need nothing everything seems to be alright with the procedures
they give me what to do but not what im looking for
the starting mass the ending mass the difference in the mass label the samples
you would have to pour vinegar in each four seperate but identical containers
and then allow the samples to sit and dry for minutes
also instead of containers use glass bottles
to replicate this lab you would need the samples to be the same masses
you would need at least containners some vinegar and label stickers
also you will might need is a watch to record your time of the mass
the reason the procedure is bad because they did not finish
after of one day remove and allow the samples for minutes
you are going to need marblelimestone woodplastic and vinegar
you will need to do the same steps over
but you need to be safe with gougles apnn maybe gougles
also to determine the difference in the mass at the end of experiment
different type of materials and different containers
the three pieces of information needed is which container kept the same mass when vinegar was poured
you could also need to pour more vinegar to each of four separate containers
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to
i would need to know how to determine the mass of each sample
id need to know what to lable the containers
before the students put the objects in the solution they should have weighed each sample
the students also should have had a control for their experiment to truly tell if their data was correct
you will also need to find new rocks to experient to find different mass of each rock
you will also need new vinegar so they dont get mixed up with the other vinegar
we would need to know the time between the starting point and the end point
the most weak sample was limestone because it lost g of mass
you would need to pour vinegar in each of seperate size identical containers
place a sample of material into a container and lable do the same with the other samples
place the different samples in different places temperatures and leave samples in their area to dry
what was their prediction before they start
after check if their prediction was right or not
i would add let all the samples sit in the vinegar to soak
make sure they are dry before making on
but i think if they do the wood the viniguer will suck upmore because wood suck any liquid up
hypothesis to take a guess wether the mass of four samples of they was going to be right
this is to replicate the starting mass ending mass and difference in mass
that is what you would need to replicate this experiment
starting mass ending mass change in mass
the additional information we would need to replicate the experiment would be the conculsion
make a data table to record each sample and the starting mass
also record the ending mass and the difference in mass
also record the lowest and highest mass
some additional information would be make sure the sample is dry to do anything else
next make sure you get all the data and make a chart
starting mass ending mass and for difference mass
you will need to pour vinegar in four new separate but idantical containers
then you will need to get four new samples
and determine the mass for four different samples
let the samples sit to dry for different amount of time
you will also need to show how you got your results and conclusion
you would need to tell us how long it stayed out there
after hours remove the samples from the containers and allow it to dry
then you would have to record your results yet again and then you would check you work
what kinds of mass should be added in so that can cause confusion
the way i know what were tha masses was the students data that was recorded
well think that you would need all of the same steps in the procedure to repeate it
but dont have to find the mass between each object
you will need the data chart also the procedure of the exprerement to replicate it
after reading the procedure i would like to know the time given for each material
also if their were any color changed and what was added to the material
you would need more vinegar and marble limestone wood and plastic to replicate the experiment
additional information you would need would be to put more time
a sample to write down the starting time ending time try other samples next time
you need a mearing cup the mearer the mass of energy
in order to be able to redo this experiment you need to have all of the information
we need to know more about how they did this experiment
the additional information that is needed is how they recorded the experiment
they need to separate that experiment more when mac
always mineral the determine and compare it to the firod time that you did the experiment
tell what happen how in the first experiment
so far in the procedure they tell you into determine the mass of samples pour vinegar into each cup
let silt for hours take samples sit and dry them
you would then received the ending mass and subtract the difference
first the stat mass should of been the same
reapent with remaining placing a striges sample into a single container
if shaken you would need to know how hard to shake it
these are the main things you need to replicate the experiment
they have to measure before the ending mass because it may different than the ending mass
to replicate this experiment you would need to state you problem
what is the person for this lab also you need to indicate your independent and dependent variables
calculate the averages from your two trials
also the independent and dependent variables
i think what i will do is to change the procedures
por vinegar into a identical containers
put marble limestone wood plastic into their separate containers
the way you would replicate the experiment is by repeating the procedure but just use a different sample ingredent
second i would need to know to measure the mass in grams
the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment form a hypothesis
i will need to collect all of my materials
i will need four containers and my four samples
i will have to place the four samples in the containers
you would also need to know who the groups hypothesis was
by knowing the hypothesis youll something to compete with your findings
and last the group should have said their control
when the group said to place a sample of one material into the o ther container then repeat
it does not make sense because people could repeat putting the sample into all the containers back to back
you dont have to wait hours for letting the sample sit in the container
additional information would consist of its shape resistance and total masses lossed to complete the experiment
one piece of information needed to replicate the experiment would be material starting because it could or from the
another would be how many of each sample you are puting in the cup
and the last could be if there was a control to the experiment
such as this the type of result you were looking for
the students would also need to keep recording every thing they see
specifically their chemical makeup and the elements contained in the samples
a second piece of information you would need to know is if there should be multiple trials
also it never said that the samples were in a container and need to include that in the beginning
determine the mass of four different samples
i think they would need safety goggles and gloves to be safe
so instead of being for hours it can be hours for best results
number pour vinegar in eatch of the four seperate not identical containers
to determine the mass of four different samples to pour vinegar in four seperate container
place a sample of one material into one container and label
one way the student could have improved the experimental design is give the names of the plastics they used
the second trail the first two numbers are higher then the two in the first trail
in conclusion some would strech alot and same wouldnt
they could improve it by adding more clamp or by streching it more
type b produced mm of strechability for t and mm for t for an increase of mm
type produced mm of stretch ability for t and mm for t decreasing by mm
and lastly type d produced mm of stretchability for t and mm for t
thats what a students conclusion would look like
maybe he use the clamp to attach it before he add in the agredienta
also what the different plastics are made off
well they improved by making the right design and following the right instructions
they could of put the time period a little longer
also for t they could of put more weight than t
the conclusion would be that the plastic in trial was stretchies for the most part trial
the student could have made it before and after instead of trial and trial
they also could have named the different type of plastics
for one the student could of use two wheights instead of one
conclusion the tape has stretched more because of the weight level has a high level of density
to improve they should make a bar graph
remove the weight and camp and measure the length of the plastic types
after you remove the weights and cound how many weight they can early stuff in the plastic
i know this to be true because there is no length difference between t t
the conclusion i get on this students data is that all the plastics have been weighed and been measured
it seems that plastic a is the most strechable because it is the only one that stretched longer
two ways that the students could improve the experiment is to name the different plastics
a overall in this experiment trial had stretched more than trial
one way the student could have improved the experiment design was by performing a third trial without weights
another way would be to allow them to hand for about minutes the rd time
but for the last too the went down or stayed the same
in conclusion the students data show that when the plastic was stretch each material stretched only mm
this is not a very big change in length
the data also showed that for one of the plastics after stretched lost a mm of length
my conclusion is trials t stretched better than t
in conclusion based on the students data there are four different type of plastic
based of the plastic are tt their amount stretched mm
and based in the dutch table t is more stretched than t
the students can describe experimental based in diffent plastic
and the students can based in that data table the t is more stretched
one way it would have been good to improve the experiment is listing the steps or procedure properly
increased by decreased by and stayed the
one way the coud of used rocks instead of weights to improve the experiment design
trial is werent stretchable and when you repeat it again it would change
i guess when the plastic reaches a certain amount it will break
the students conclusion was not much because there was many types of plastics to choose from
other reason is that they not the weights in the same spot in trial and trial
also to use different plastics to see different results
the plastic streched more and more each time
another way he could improve is he could add heavier weights to get better data
for plastic tube a and b the amount stretched went up a point
for plastic tube c it went down a pont and for d the plastic stretched stayed the same
also hey could of changed the amount weight was on the clamp to
to me it would be also helpful if a control was run to compare results
in conclusion after five minutes the plastic types were stretched longer for plastics a and b
two ways the student could have improved the experiment are
added or decreased the weights amount in trial let the weights hang for longershorter amount of time
their data could have been put clearer also
a conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type d was stretched the most
plastic type d stretched the most but on the second trial plastic type a made the most difference
so deffentally improve by keeping the time same
on the first step the should be more specific for the type of plastic
another way would be that they could of see how much of something it could hold
another thing the students could work on would be to define the control
the type stretched out differently depending on how much weight was put on them
both plastic types b and d stretched out of all the plastic types
he could have listed all materials first
based on the data i conclude plastic d is the stretchiest type of plastic
one way the students could have improved the experiment was to record anything that went wrong
to show how much a the stretchability of each plastic
also telling us how long do they want the plastic stretched
in the conclusion the plastic strech out longest in t the t
the student used different plastic to determine its stretchability
a conclusion based on the data is that all the plastic types have ranged around the same number
with the students data you can tell that trials arent that much different in the amount stretched
the amount the four plastic types stretched in test one and test two were almost the same
in conclusion plastic a is the strongest and plastic d is the weakest
and you can also have at least one other person there to varify this
to draw a conclusion i would figure out the patium to this data table
my conclusion is that they did a pretty good job setting up the data table
they not only tried it once they tried it twice
extend the time of the weight longer like about minutes more
my conclasion is that t had a better amount stretched than t had
and the seeena way is they should have said what types of plastics and tapes they was using
the conclusion of this lab shows that in the first trial the plastic was stretched mm
supprisingly in the third trial it actually got smaller by mm
also the last trial it stayed the same length
the first way they could improve the experiment would be to test different amounts of weight
they should also only measure what hangs over the table both times for a more precise result
athe amount stretched by t showed more improvement by having it stretched because the different material
both were investigated at the same time
a in conclusion the amount strech t streched a little bit more than t by mm
i shows that t can strech more than t
then the student could have recorded more valid and improved data on a chart
and it would change by adding more weights because the plastic wouldnt be resible as the other one
the conclusion is most student plastic stretched more then others
they could improved the experiment by leaven the clips mins
the students could of lable the chart better than the did
the could have one add more info to the procedure and state why they are doing this experiment for
they should had left more minutes to hang
a plastic d length did not increase or decrease in both trials
since their results in both trials were close they shouldve tested it rersus another
t and t are very close with their data
they couldve increased the time to hang the plastics to ten minutes instead of five
according to the data table plastic type a was the most strechable
type b and c decreased when measured again after having placed weights and type d stayed the same
therefore type a was the most strechable considering the longitude it made by mm
the students have to make sure the test results are accurate and that the answers are precise
b two ways the students had did different times for each trial
when the student tested each plastic a stretched times more than before
a the polymer experiment looks it went very well
each plastics amount that was stretched was all around the same number for both trials
another way is to try and measure the polymer plastic more than once after being pulled
for both trials they had similar results
they could have improved their experiment by adding more weights instead of keeping them the same
still showing that type t was the best choice
it showed that in the end type b was the strongest
the results shown below arent as aromatic as you can see
also the student could have added more time for each time he repeated the investigation
the conclusion is plastic type have and amounts stretched
a the second try has almost the same amount of stretchability the first try has
we could use anothe plastic type and will try the amount of stretching
in conclusion plastic type b was the strongest out of all the plastic types
also they could have created a graph to show their results in a clearer way
perform the second trial different than the first
a if you hang weights on plastic type b then it will stretch at least inchs
validity on the experiment with no changes is correct because the use extra trials
i dont think his stretchability investigation work
next time i would recommend trying different weights to see if the amount of weight will determined the length
also we can add more time to how long the weights stays on the plastic
the students could have improved there experiment by making diffrent data graphs
they could have also improved there expriment by solving the resolts by adding or subtracting
a my conclusion is that the expirement was very un organized and not well thought out
just to give us more of a second thought about how theyre data came out
they could have organized their data alot better
in conclusion t was mostly longer than t because t had more higher measure than t
one way this student could of improve is he could of put heaver weights
another was he could of done it was he kept reducing the tape size
t had stretched more than trial t for plastic type a b
then is was lower than t then plastic type d was exactly the sam
the second way would be to write down the average of the t and t
a conclusion based on the students data is which plastic stretched the most
plast type a for t and t has the lowst stretch amount
the conclusion it draws from this is that they
in conclusion in the st trial all of the plastics here higher
i believe the amount of plastic stretched in the second trial depends on the type of plastic
in the second trial the length for plastic a and b went up
for plastic c the longer length was in the first trail
but in plastic d the amount stretched stood exactly the same
plastic type a was the only type of plastic that stretched the most
the student could of improved the experiment design by having two measuring devices
also they could of used heavier weights
plastic d is a reasonable plastic to be used as stretchability
pandas in china and koalas from australia are similar because they are both specialist
they both are different from a python because a python is a generalist
pandas eat bamboo while koalas eat eucalyptus leaves
but a python is a more diverse and invasive animal
i eats a broader range of things from smaller reptile to amphibians
the difference between the two koala and panda from a python is the different environments they live in
for example the pythons lives along the canals of cape coral pandas and koalas live near forest
the pandas and the koalas are similar because they both are specialist
they are different because theyre from different parts of the world and they eat different food
the pandas and koalas only eat bamboo and eucalyptus leaves
chinas panda are different to australias koala bear because panda eats almost nothing but bamboo
and koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively
the phython can eat anything pretty much
thats how the phython is different from the pandas and koala
the koala eats eucalyptus leaves and pandas eat only bamboo
pandas eats almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively
verse pythons are generalist that could eat anything
they are different from a python because a python eats almost anything and a koala bear in panda donot
these two bears on arent harming anything by eating the foods
but pythons eat almost anything that moves and they are harming the enviornnent
pandas and koala are similar because they are both specialists
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they are both specialists
pandas and koalas are different from pythons because pythons can live anywhere from florida to antarctica to outer space
they are both different from pythons because they are not seen no a threat
where as pythons are a threat even to other animals like in the article a python ate an alligator
pandas and koalas are both mamals and humb
the pandas in china are similar to the koala bear in australia because they are not harmful
also they dont eat a lot of diffrent things they eat bamboo and eucalyptus leaves
they are diffrent from pythons because pythons eat whatever is around if they are hungry
pandas are similar to koala bears because they both eat a very limited amount of food
paragraph states that pandas eat almost only bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves
pandas koala bears both eat plants while the snakes eat animals
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they both only really eat one kind of food
they are specialists and are favored by stability
these a animals are different from pythons because pythons are predators that constantly eat meat

when one thinks of snakes it usually the jungle that pops into mind
macinnes thinks that they were introduced and are now fine and safe
the significance of the word invasive mean that its a threat to a past
some people dont like having a python living near them and find it invasive
invasive plays a big part in the articles
i shows that the animals that are dangerous can cause an intrusion
yes the can be harmful but if you have bread them they wont do harm
theyve just considered predators where theyre from
the word invasive is very significant in the article
this word is telling the reader that reptiles are a very intense species
also they are unlike vary other animal
the word invasive means that the reptiles can be wild animals at all time
invasive to the article means that other species under go a lag before proliferating or multiplying
bearing that if you see one you must leave it more
invasive is significant because it implies that reptiles invade your home and are unwanted pests
because there saying how people started banging in species to new places
and macinnes says of being forced there being introduced
the mrna first gets on an electron transport chain
the organelle then reads the infornmation and makes proteins
anaphase metaphase prophase telophase
prophase metaphase anaphase telophase
it sends instructions for the amino acid sequence if a protein
protein synthesis is needed in your body because of the proteins
the four major steps are when it occurs in the body and when your body uses the protien
by the end of the mrnas journey protein is formed
the dna then begins to reproduce then mitosis takes place then the off spring is present
the mrna leaves the cell cell makes protienmrna bings it back cell uses it
it will find a chromosome then attach to it
it will then go through codons before adding on to it
the first major step involved in protein synthesis is mrna leaving the nucleus
passive transport brings proteins in and out of the cell
cells are know to use many things in cell mvment such as mrna
mrna tell instructions to the messenger trna makes proteins and oxygen and hydrogen
the mrna is copied and the coped strand is taken to the
first starting at the mrna it goes to trna which transfers it to rrna and then grna
after the mrna leaves the nucleus it takes the sequence to the cytoplasm
then the rrna transports it to to the trna
then the trna takes it to the opposite sequence of dna where the process is completed
mrna diffusion energy sunlight protein leaving the cell
prophas metaphas anaphas and telaphas
proteins need calciumthey need vitaman cthey need iron
trna transfers proteins mrna sends instructions to other proteins
you have to have a code to find the codon
you have to use the condon to find where you start at
after you find where you stop at you should figure out what it says
dna where is stores information trna where it transcribes protein synthesis mrna where it sends information
it leaves the nucleus for amino acid sequence of a protein
protiens leavetravel down to the mebraneonce they get to the mebrane they then bondand connect
it goes from mrna to trna ro rrna to rna
trnarrnaremovement of unwanted proteinsthe mrna leaves the nucleus to send instructions to other cells
ribosomes message is transfered carried to nucleus protein synthesis
it may be that dna is going to take place
then last it makes copys of more protein
trna transfers information to the dna rrna grna rna multiplies
make sure it get safely to the place where the organism needs it
the mrna sends the genetic code to trna
then the trna takes the genetic code to the ribosomes
the ribosome receives the genetic information and gets help from another mrna
mrna leads to trna and rrna and then the final step which is either translocation or translation
the mrna travels to through the cytoplasm to the midocondrion and it copies itself to trna
the trna goes and copies itself to the rrna and it sends the instructions to ribosomes and the midocondrion
one step is metaphasesome others are prophaseantiphase and interphase
in protein synthesis the nucleus controls what happens in the cell
proteins are carried out by rna and the site of protein synthesis is rer
well the organism is going to get sick but then get really healthy
mrna is translated from dnadna is what makes up mrnatrna transforms mrna into amino acidsrrna copies the tranafer rnd
the mrna is translated into trna then its sent to the mitochondria to be coded
the mrna makes protiens and sends it smowhere else
the first step would have to be building of bones and other body parts in the body
the second step would be protecting from viruses
the third step would be building a proactive life span
and the fourth step would be keeping the body safe and healthy
it has to change to trna then it has to find the amino acids
and then it has to come up with the right proteins
anaphase intrephase prophase and metaphase
after mrna leaves with information it then takes it to trna
after this is done trna is helping produce atp for protiens
after this process is done rrna comes in
rrna is later fixing together the protiens
the mrna then goes and takes the nformation outside of the nucleus
then the message that the mrna is carrying gets put in with a dna sequence
this dna sequence is what is used to make copies of the dna
mrna leaves the nucleus and carries to the mitochondria
protein spreads throughtout the body
need to be reproduced to maintain the source
interphase metaphase anaphasetelophase
the mrna sends messages through the nucleus
when mrna leaves the nucleus and goes with a message transport it
mrna leaves the nucleus proteins evolve from amino acids
after leaving the neucleus the mrna carries the information to the amino acids for the sequence of proteins
then it goes through trna and then rrna
four major steps are messager leaving the rna
after mrna leaves the nucleus protine synthesis involves amino acid sequence trna rrna and grna
afterwards it will remove itself and move on to another dna strand
it moves on to oher placeto a nither nucleusbuild more mrnastart new life
after mrna leaves the nucleus the codons are translated to trna and are translated into dna
anaphaseinterphase metaphase and telophas are the four major steps involved in protein synthesis
the steps all involve in mrna leaving the nucleus and than create other cells
the steps are to first get the nutrients out
then secondly get the protien out of it
goes to the golgi apparatus then the endo plasmic ritculam and then leaves the nucleus
it is then translated meaning it is read
then it is transcripted so that it can be used for whatever it is needed
mrna leaves the nucleus and the eventually develops into trna and rrna
prophase anaphase interphase and metophase are the four major steps
first the mrna must identify the protein needed for protein synthesis
the mrna then travels to the mitochondria
the mitochondria will then begin to produce the new protein that is needed
it goes through the organisms and leads through the process
four major steps that are involved in protien synthesis are fermentationlactic acidtransfusionand transduction
eatdigesttake care of bodyrespect your body
after mrna leaves the nucleus respiration occurs
after respiration transcription beings and in transcription mrna is copied
next translation occurs and translation is the procces where mrna is taken to the nucleus
memabrain nucleuscarbon dioxideoxygenphotosynthesis
mrna sends out instructions to the amino acids to produce proteins
after mrna leaves trna helps translate into protein then the protein gathers energy and finaly starts reproducing
match the acids together to make a new protein strand
the rna divides into mrna and then the mrna goes out and gives coded instructions to the organelles
step mrna has to be changed into rrnastep
one of the strands have to leave and another hooks onstep
the mrna sends a message with the amino acid sequence to ribosomes telling it to make protein
then the trna transports enzymes to be converted
they unzipthey copy the informationthey rezip they have now made two copies of the information
trna transfers the mrnarna changes into rnadna links with dnadna strand dna strand is created
the mrna sends a message to the rna to begin protein synthesis
prophase metaphase anaphase interphase
then the rrna helps the proteins break down
the trna transports the proteins to and from cells
cell walls allow the protein inside for use
when mrna leaves the nucleus then mrna will go to a different cell to do reproduction
carries instructions from the nucleus to the amino acids sequence of a protein
anaphase metaphase prophase and telophase
transcription occurs then translation takes place
then transfer rna decodes and sends the information to have rrna take place
first the protein is made then it forms
after it forms then it starts to make the protein
trna carries instructions from nucleusgrna follows the instructionsrrna goes back to the nucleus
translation transcription cellular respiration
nucleus endoplasmgolgi body cell membrane
mrnamessenger rna leaves the nucleus and delivers genetic information to the amino acid sequence in protein
the information is transcribed then rrna repeats the sequence
four ways are leaving to go to rrna disolving
transcription and translation is what happens
trna transfer rna takes the mrna and puts it where it needs to go
porteins carry thing to differnt organsthere to help body funtions
step one the membrane og the synthesis past the cell up but the nucleus powers it
the microdria pushs everthing threw and for the amino acids sequence of the protein
rna is turning in to mrnamrna is turning in to protein
development compounding formation distribution
dna which is the body making its red blood cells
rna which is the body making its white blood cells
mna which is the body making its brains certain cells
when the mrna leaves the nucleus it then goes into the cytoplasm where it turns into trna
the trna then has the codon which codes for the amino acid
from the amino acid it then goes through protein synthesis
mrna delivers the information to the nucleustrna gives the directionsthe rna forms proteinprocess starts over
after the mrna leaves the nucleus it brings it to the mitocondria
the protein replicates itself to make many more proteins so that they body has everything that it needs
the translation will take the mrna and change into trna
for example if you have uau gcu then the new strand in trna would be aua cga
after this then the strands will form the amino acids
then you got the amino acids needed for energy and protein synthesis
the first step is for messanger rna to leave the nuclues
after it has done this it goes to a trna that links to it and copies its opposite protiens
then the trna is linked to by codons wich forms the code for the protiens
then the newly formed protiens are sent to where they will be needed
protein synthesis helps the body to function
protein synthesis is very important to have
the are transported on the cell membrane
first you have to show that the protein is alive
next it goes to the new cell and that is all
with proteins they are able to give you the needed amount of energy
protein going through out the body and then protein leaving the body which you need more protein everyday
mrna tells the oraganelles what to do to help the cell with reproducing
it would involve replicating and dividing the cell to become two cells
the mrna is the messenger so it sends the message to other parts of the cell
mrna leaves the nucleus the body starts another cycle another mrna is produced mrna leaves the cell
after mrna leaves the nucleus it pairs up with another strand comtaining the opposite nucleotides
this dna strand considered trna then attaches to a protein to code for an amino acid
the amino acid stays attached to the protein
the mrna changes into trna or grna or it will change into rrna
mrna leaves the nucleus but is transported to the mitochondriathe mitochondria has trna send a messages to the nucleus
once the message is received the rrna performs the functionthen it repeats starting back with the mrna
mrna is the messengertrna transports the rnarrna relicates the rnaprotien synthesis is the product after the process
we get more healthy no deaths more nutrients no diseases
four major steps involved in protein synthesis are recreation bounding healing and protecting
the mrna turns in to rna which is the transfered to the nucleus
from there the rna turns in to dna as we know it
it leaves and it creates more mrnas and that helps your body
the mrna brings the codes to the organelles that produce protein
it drops off the codes and the proteins are made
the trna leaves and goes to the nucleus to copy the codes again through transcription
then it gets sorted and it brings rna back
anaphase metaphase telophase prophase
the mrna will take the codes for the protein to the trna
the trna will transfer it to the rrna which will take it to the ribosomes
after mrna leaves the nucleus the nucleus disappears
the third stage is when trna is placed together to help make more ribosomes
trna sends the protein to the mitochondria
the mitochondria uses the protein for energy
the mrna goes through the gogli appartis
transcriptiontrasnlocationgene expressiondna synthesis
it brings the protein to this place where dna is made
when mrna leaves the nucleus it goes through pmat
then a mrna will find the corresponding piece to the nucleotide
next comes a trna which gets the corresponding piece to the nucleotide
once all the pieces are brought together to form the protein it will be put together by a rrna
it is very helpful to protein synthesis
the first step involved with protien synthesis is activation
mrna must activate the hormone that starts replication
the second step is the hormone helicase dividing the two strands of dna to be read
dna polymerase replicates the dna by matching the codons with the anticodon making rna
the forth and final step is rezipping the dna strand into one uninteruppted strand
the golgi body sends out the dna the mitrocondria is the power house
it helps the body in matining strong muscles
the messager rna tells the other rnh what to do
producesdiegestion resptoiry protein synthesis
the mrna copies its self exactly then those change themselves with a special codon along with amino acids
protein synthesis involves for major steps
protein synthesis is a very complicated process
the mrna leaves the nucleus to transfer a message to the trna
the trna transfers all the protiens into there new form
then telophase changes them back and gives them each a condon
heals protects kills bad organisms and leaves it
interphase anaphase telophase metaphase epicphasednanucleus cellsequence
interphase anaphase telephase prophase
protein synthesis involves mrna which sends messages and trna which is transfer rna
the mrna leaves and transfers into trna because mrna is the messenger rna
mrna leaves the nucliusgoes to the mitochondria
prophase metaphase anaphase and telophase are all major steps involved in protein synthesis
the mrna comes out of the cell and to protein
then changes the rna strand to an mrna strand and makes proteins from there
the mrna enters into the dna and creates a copy of it
then the mrna gives off information to the trna
replicate its dna and then ship it away to be replicated in a different way creating rna
the trna then takes the protein to the cell
anaphase metaphase telaphase they keep repeating these steps plus one more step
one process is cell divison which divids the cells up
the four major parts of protein synthesis are rrna trna mrna grna
the mrna carries instructions from the necleous for the amino acid sequence of a protein
all these steps put together allows protein synthesis to occur
trna trainingdrna begingarna middleerna ending
after the mrna leaves the nucleus it contacts the trna to transfer information
the information is then carried on by rrna
when the rnas are done they get together to form a protein
then mrna travels to where the amino acid sequences are being made
then it is coped using trna and made into a serparate strand using rrna
interphase telophase anaphase and prophase
the next step after the mrna is the trna and that is the transer dna
that holds the message that the dna gave the mrna
after that is when the membrane get the information
after that is when the body responds to that
it starts with mrna then it goes to rrna then trna then finally grna
it travels to the amino acids with instructions of how to make a protein
the trna is formed that will match a specific amino acid
trna connects with a specific amino acid and a protein is formed
eating the right foodsdrinking wateractivityexercising
the messenger rna sends information to the transfer rna
the transfer rna relays the information to the ribosomal rna
the ribosomal rna attaches to other rna
an enzyme activates the manufacture of protiens between the rna molecules in the nucleolus
rna stand for ribo nucleicaciddna stand for dioxiribo nucleicacid
eating sleeping oxygen nutrients
copying dna dividing exiting the cell finding a new cell
the mrna takes the protein synthesis and sends it where its suppose to go
mrna is very important because it tells about the cells in your body
the strand then unzips and trna attaches to the unziped dna strand
translationreplicationtranstionadaptation
the messenger must get the signal to its place
the dna unzip trna carrys the anti codon to the amino acids
coding to get it out of the cell then translation to use it
there is transporting of proteinsalso proteins are checked and sent off
the four major steps involved in protein synthesis are
mrna passes the nucleus to dna and dna makes it reproduce
step they travel through the bodystep they enter the spot they need to be
step they get to the spot they need to be
there is regular rna mrna trna and protein synthesis
you just make the letters go to their opposites
the mrna leaving the nucleus creates a structure for the proteins to leave the cell
after this the cell works to make new proteins
it goes threw all the cell parts before being defined
the mrna strand photosynthesises into a suitbale living condition for the body
trnatranscribe mrna into dnagrna gather informationrrnamrnacarries insruction to the amino acid of a protein
third the process is slowed down and anticodons are brought to the mrna
fourth the translation occurs and amino acids are linked together to form a new copy
interfase is the longest phase in the cycle
after interfase is prophase which is the first stade of meiosis
the second stage is anaphase which the nucleus splits in two
it leaves the nucleus then it gos to where it needs to go
then it seperates and makes brand new strands of what is needed
it mutiplies really fast and then makes more and more of what is needed
mrnais the messanger which leaves the nucleus
trna transfer information to the ribosome
the mrna delivers a code to the mitochondria
then it translates the code into amino acids
the amino acids are then put into specific codes based on what the mrna said
first the endoplasmic reticulum takes the protein and breaks it down
secondly the ribezomes compress what is left down
then the golgi apparatus takes it to the cell membrane
the cell membrane then takes it out of the cell
gathering protein needs to breath so it needs more room
mrna leaves the nucleusit makes a copy of itselfthe copy then makes proteinand transcription occurs
transcriptionreplicationtraslationtransfussion
creating energygoing throught metaphase prophase interphase
mrna leaves the cell it tells the enzyems which dna strand to work on
the enzyme strats to decode the dna strand into complumentary rna
the genetic material is transcribed into rna form
the genetic material is taken to the ribosomes
mrna leaves the nucleustrna startsgrna startsrrna starts
the mrna leaves the nuclear membranedna copies itselfthe old dna dies
the mrna leaves the nucleus transporting information
then the mrna travels to the cells membrane
then the mrna drops off the information then goes back to the nucleus
then is will be taken to where it can get energy
there are four major steps involved in protein synthesis
the mrna cells must replicate in order to leave the cell
lastly they will zip back together to make more copies
then it is read by the protein creating the amino acid
energystores foodprotects the cell and foodhelps it stay alive
mrna comes and takes the dna into the cytoplam
trna transfers it which makes a protein
diffusion mitosis meiosis and genetic diffusion
it goes to the nucleus and transports the message
mrna leaves the nucleus travels through the body and into the the brain
then it goes throught transription where it copies then it translates then becomes a protien
the protein must be copied by the nucles
next the cell must carry out the function
finally the process ends and starts all over again
the messenger rna tranfers information in protein synthesis
it also uses the golgi apparatuss information to help it go where it needs to go
mrna leaves the nucleus by a small opening in the nucleus
then it slids into places by slidding in between the two broken strands
after that the mrna is then transferred out of the cell trhough the cell membrane
when the mrna leaves the nucleus there are four major steps involved in protein synthesis
first the mrna takes coded instructions to the nuclues
after that the instructons are used to assemble the amino acids to the ribosomes
finally the new strains of ribosomes can be used finishing protein synthesis
it has four major steps along the way witch are all very important
they all have very important jobs to do
telophasemetaphaseprophase interphase i think i am not sure
mrna begin to duplicate the dna into an rna form
this then creates another dna strand of course after being checked for errors and mutations
in the end the dna connects up again after having to split for duplication
messenger rna collects the information it needs to copy dna then trna changes thymine to uracil
ribosomes form proteinsmitochondria make proteins for energyproteins move through the cell membrane to the rest of the organism
interphase telophase anaphase metaphase proshase
carbon dioxide hydrogen oxygenand nitrogen
mrna leaves the nucleus and seperates in half
the half of the mrna gets copied and is sent to the new nucleus
the mrna ends up changing into a different protein
messenger rnatranscribes transfer rnatransfersbreak downsmakes them codons that can be made into proteins
gives messages to the proteintranformingtranscibing then comes up with sequences for the type of amino acid
after mrna leaves the nucleus it travels through the cell into the cytoplasm
then the codon comes and so do the amino acids
next the mrna carries the instructions for the new sequence and codes for new dna
the mrna goes through the dividing wall and into the trna and into a section of the dna
it then goes to the amino acids and create a protein
genetically changegentic disorderdifferent speciesmutation
the rna goes through a ventricle and makes atp
decodes ittakes it to trnatrna takes it to the ribosomesribosomes make protiens
the mrna has to travel through the cell to get to were it can exit
the mrna has to deliever the proteins to were they need to go
mrna gives data to trna and then its turned into amino acids
another major step would be the loss of nucleus
a major step would have to be passing the dna through the cell to the nucleus
the last major step would have to be the organells helping to pass the antibodies to fight infection
the proteins are made then carried by the ribsome and then released into the body to make energy
mrna changes in to rrna and goes out in the rest of the cell
the protein is eaten usued digested and flushed out
mrna leaves nucleustrna transfers proteins
the mrna must leave the nucleus and travel through the cytoplasm
the mrna must then converge with the different protein bases
the proteins mix in the the mrna to create a strand
the protein synthesis is made when the strand reaches the normal dna
one step involved in protein synthesis is the trna moving ribosomes
another step in protein synthesis is rrna making the proteins
chromosomes attachthey seperatenew nucleus is formedanother one is formed
annaphase prophase interphase and metaphase
the trna then transports it to the rrna
mrna splits up and meets with the nuclaic acid
then it is combined with phosphate to create a protein
translation deletion translocation transformation
well the dna splits and makes copies of rna and then repeats the process
the mrna is translated in to amino acidsthe codons take their placeand the new sequence is finshed
sugars come in and out of the cell during proteinsynthesisthe immiune system build up stronger
dna is coped to rna rna exites the cell rna goes to the ribosomes ribosomes produse the gene matereal
protein synthesis codon changes reaction happens new messanger trna
the mrna scans the rna to find out what the complementary proteins are
the trna brings the complementary strands
amino acids are made and go into the organelles
mrna has to leave the nucleus then it transfers information to trna
after it does that it makes copies then lastly sends it back to mrna
it takes the protein over to another organelle
then the protein gets sent all over the cell
in prophase the nuclear membrane begans to disappear
then in anaphase the chromosomes began to break apart and go to opposite poles
then in metaphase they chromosomes are at opposite poles
then the cell begans to break apart into two whole new cells
translation the items are moved into a diferent order
transformation the items are changed into other sequences
deletion a certian pertion is deleted
substitution a certian amino acid is traded out for a different one
last the information acts like a blueprint as the thing needed is built
then the protein travel to the endoplasmic reticulum
they also take a stop in the golgi apparatus and then they also go into the mitochondria
translocation is moving the information translation is copying the information replication is making the copied information
once mrna leaves the nucleus it changes size
molecules go to the goli apparatus wich then prepares them which then
the strand is translated into another language that the mrna understands
the mrna goes out of the nucleus and to the trna
then the trna translates the rna and creates aminp acids to go along with the rna
the second is changing into trna to deliver information
the fourth and final step is messenger it syntheises
the mrna leaves the nucleus and enter the cytoplasm
mrna strands bind together in the cytoplasm
the mrna binds with amino acids to for the ribosomes
the new ribosome creates proteins as needed by the cell
the mrna grabs onto a cell and goes throughout the body
ribosomes shape the mrna into a protein decoding what it says to know what the proteins job is
vesicules transport the protein to where it needs to be
membran protein sends the proteing out side of the cell if its needed
prophase anaphase metaphase telophase
dna to rna then coded for amino acids then make protein
when mrna leaves the nucleus it goes and tells the cell what dna sequences to make
then trna takes the message back to the nucleus
once at the rrna the instructions go through translation which result in a new protein
transfers to trnamakes an amino acid sequencedecodes the amino acid sequencesends it to the
mrna goes out and finds trna and this information gets coded to that
cleans bacteria help cells and all dna and cleans
anaphase metaphase prophase and telophase
after the mrna leaves the nucleus it travels through the cytoplasm
then it travels to the mitochondria where it goes through transcription
then it detatches from the mitochondria and goes through translation
mitochondria makes proteinsmrna passes proteins to ribosomesribosomes take proteins to nucleusnucleus uses proteins for energy
spread out and collect the cells go through the cell cycle
continue through the cycle til process is completed
after mrna leaves the nucleus transcription occurs
mrna is messenger rna and carries the message to chromosomes
the chromosomes then take that information and arrange the proteins accordingly
mrna leave the nucleus brings information to the amino acid amino acid produces protein
once the mrna leaves the nucleus is goes through the blood stream
after all that the mrna is needed no longer
then comes the trna that will help the other nucleus figure out the message
then it helps the nucleus decode the new message to where it will make sense to the nucleus
the rrna picks up on the new decoded message
once the rrna is done getting the message it takes it
the last step would be to take the code and make another rna sequence
mrnawhich is the messengertrnawhich transfeers all of the information rrnareplicates the dnagrna
the mrna leaves the nucleus and then becomes a trna
the last part is where it becomes rrna and helps the ribosomes enzymes and protein
nucleotides ribonucleic nuclear membrane and nucleoplasm are four major steps involved in the protein synthesis
the mrna copies the anti codons from the dna and transports it through the cytoplasm
then it meets up with the trna and makes an amino acid
this causes many changes within the cell
the mrna is taken to the cytoplasmthe trna helps to create the new protien
lightindependent ractions lightdependent reactions
it stays in the mitochondrion to produce more protein
the virus because it will kill you really bad
mrna leaves the nucleus to go and be checked for errors
it carries the insturction on what to do and how to react
the four main steps involed in protein synthesis are transcription translation sequencing and separating
transcription is when the rna is read and translation is when the new rna strans are made
trna transcripts and the amino acids are made when the base pairs join
the left over bases are removed from the cell by the lysosome
mrna directs the rna to make the protiens then a signal from the nucleus tells it to stop
when the mrna leaves the nucleus it divides the new dna into all of the different cells
after it leaves the nucleus it then goes to the trna to give it some memory
then after that it goes to the rrna to make more ribosomes
the messenger rna conects to amino acids to givedirections to them
protiens are then conected to the mrna an connected to the amino acids creating more rna
rna arrives from other cellrna copied translation rna tranported through mrna
it goes and copies a protien for the sequence
it goes to the to the nuclues then gets coded on the dna and then turns into waste
the four major steps involved in protein synthesis are prophase metaphase anaphase and telophase
proteins become stableorgenelles become numerousthe reproduction rate becomes high
then the trna goes and gets the codons from the amino acids so they can build their protein
last they put the amino acids in order and then you get a protein strand
its good for youmakes you stronggood for health
mrna then codes for pretiens that bind with rrna
mrna carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of a protein
protein gos into the blood and around the body
prophase anaphase interphase metaphase
protein synthesis is carried out through a long process
duplication translocation replication mitosis
mrna then sends its message to the nuclear membrane to creat certain dna codes for it
then the sequence of creating dna begins
anaphase prophasemetephase and telephase
the trna will deliver instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence to produce proteins
rna it happensdna it really happensrrna this doesnt happenmrna i really hope that this happens
trna rrna transcription translocation transference
helping the mrna in able for it to complete the synthesis
first the nucleus would go through metaphase
second the nucleus would go through anaphase
third the nucleus would go through telophase
last the nucleus would go through cytokenisis
it turms into trna and travels to the ribosome
it picks up surrounding amino acids and takes them to the ribosome
it forms rrna and begins binding the amino acids in the ribosome
collecting nutriants storing them anaphase and then there is prophase
mrna leaves the nucleus carrying instructions for the amino acid sequence to create proteins
the trna takes the coded dna and translates it to amino acids
rrna then takes the information to the center of all the protein synthesis
four major steps involved in protein synthesis are mrna leaving the nucleus
trna carries instruction from nucleus for amino acid sequence of a protein
the four major steps involved in protien synthesis are rrna trna grna the process ends
gets dna messages spreading through the cell
helps break down dna codes needed for cell cycle
after mrna it will go to trna and then i will coil so much to where it becomes dna
it just puts protein out through the body to keep it healthy and gives you energy to do things
the prophase lets the rna form the chromosomes
anaphase seperates them on opposite ends of the cell
then telophase seperates them into new cells
then passes on the information needed to make proteins
the cells gather and conect the parts needed to make the protein
the last step is finished to form and pass on the protein
mrna leaves the nucleus and sends amino acid sequence to the rrna
rrna goes to the mitochondria and gives it instruction to build the protein
once protein is created trna attaches to a hydrogen atom
trna carries the hydrogen to the protein and forms a covalent bond with the protein
trna transfers the data to the cytoplasmrrnamakes the proteins
the steps following are transcription initiation elongation termination
protein and rna structures are finished
they make a copy of the dna and then they replicate it and then translate it
mrna then goes to the trna where the trna makes an exact copy of the template
the trna then matches up with the correct spot on the organelle
then the organelle makes a protein that the body needs and sends it to were it is needed
anaphase metaphase telaphase and prophase
translation is when dna is copied into rna then the rna is copied into mrna in transcription
prophase metaphase anaphase and telophase
after mrna leaves the nucleus transcription and translation occur
transcription is the copying of the strand and translation is moving the sequences for the strand
there is also replication which makes an exact replicate of the dna strand
after the mrna leave the nucleus trna come in and gets a gentic copy of the mrna
then takes the information to make a amino acid sequence
then from there it goes to the cell membrane
after that it travels to the golgi apperatous
when mrna leaves the nucleus there are four major steps involved for protein synthesis
they are prophase metaphase anaphase and telophase
prophase is where the nuclear membrane dissapear and the chromosomes split
metaphase is where the chromosomes line up
the trna is transcribed into rrna which can then be used by the body to synthesize proteins
first it goes to the cells and then the cells take it and follow the directions
trna gives the amino acid to the protien
mrnatrnaand rrnamrna sends messages to the nuclues
trna transports proteins through the cell
it copies itself then it translates then it transcripts
prtein synthesis takes place after leaving the nucleus
the four major steps are movement reproduction growth and new rna
mrna as a polymer is involved in protein synthesis
the first step in protein synthesis is after leaving the nucleus the mrna will look for the protein
the second step is the mrna will copy the protein
the proteins are then sent to the areas of the body that they are needed in
the mrna brings the information to the trna
the trna transports the codons to the mitochondrion
the mitochondrion synthesizes the proteins and the trna transports the proteins to where they need to go
which that is starting to split into two different cells
which is were the cells are apart and at on there own
first they leave the body then copy themselves then transfer last they make a new strand
mrna goes into translation were the protiens move
then were it is moved again and then it zips up again
trna is the transporterrnadna the structure of an organismmrna
the four major steps are transcription transportation conversion and rrna
it has to go through all the rna first then it goes to the protein synthesis
the dna turns into mrnathen the mrna turns into trnathe cycle happens over again
the mrna leaves the nucleus and transcribes the dna codes to the trna
then the trna turns these codes into rna codes
from there the rrna makes doubles of all of the new information
they carry all the information from the nucleus for the amino acid of the protein
they have to make new copies of the information to put for trna
then they leave the nucleus and the trna travels in
the first step is that mrna leaves the nucleas
the mrna then gets the trna to make a covalent bond
the line is fromed in the middle of the cellanaphase where the cell divides into two cells
when the mrna leaves the nucleous the protiens go with it
the trna coming and bringing the amino acidsmrna taking the amino acids to the ribosomes where they are made
they match up with the dna sequence put into bonds that were copied and then changed
mrna sends messages on what to transcript
prophase metaphase anaphase and telephase
amino acid makes the protienthe protien does stuff with the ribosome
it goes to the michochindria and starts attaching codons to make aprotein
you have the mrna that takes to the original rna and makes everything right agian
the trna leave the cellrealesespeptic bonds it eneter the nuclus and the mrna
it leaves the nucleusit roams aroundit looks for a way backit returns
after it leaves the nucleus it then goes to the
the four major steps involved in protein synthesis are anaphaseprofacemetaphaseinterphase
it starts going throught many different sages it prepares for itself to double
prophasemetaphaseanaphase and interphase
active transport lets proteins pass through
the first amnio acid comes and attaches to the mrna then dehydration synthesis occurs
after that the hydrogen bond brakes and that amnio acid goes to find more protien
well you might have to go through the cleanins and purifing stage
the mrna delivers the message so its like the messenager
the mrna leaves the nucles and is then coped by ribosomes and is turned into the protein
the mrrna then moves to the mitochondria
from there the mitochondria reads the sequence of mrna
once the sequence is read a supplementary copy is made
the supplementary copy is then synthesized by the mitochondria
when the mrna leaves the nucleus it gets strands then it creates sequences and they turn into amino acids
after turning into amino acids they become energy
leaves nucleus enters body delivers messages about amino acid sequence heads back to nucleus
first the newly formed mrna branches away from the stand of dna
second the information carried by the mrna is transported to a new cell
third the information carried by the mrna is copied into the new cell
lastly the cell then creates the dna structures that were copied
tranlsation transcription transformation
the ribosome uses protien synthesis to make protiens
the nucleus disappearsmrna reaches its destination
translation deletion transformation and transcription
that that is a bacteria that cant cause cancer on your system
prophase metaphase anaphase telaphase
it carrries it to where its going then it
after mrna has left the nucleus it floats around until it finds a matching strand
well the rna does not want to be there any more
amino acids help build protein and sugars for atp
anaphase telephase prophase and interphase
mrna leaves the nucleus then the chromosomes split move to different sides and create two new cells
it transfers the protein to the nucleus
dna is unzipped copied and zipped back up
the copied strand is the mrna wich is then copied also
major steps in protien synthesis is the mrna leaves the nucleus
it separates strands and divides out of the nuleuss walls
then the new copy is sent inside the nucleus
there are many parts to this process but these are the main ones
mrna leavesorganelles appearmutation startsthe mitochondrian is working harder
mrna then it a messanger to the dna then to defusion
interphasemetaphaseanaphase and telophase
the second stage is the mrna getting his own place so he can start out fresh and brand new
trna transfer rna transfers the dna sequence by codons and figures out the genetic code
rrna ribosomial rna gives the information to a ribosome organelle which now holds all the information
prophasemetaphaseanaphasetelophasehaha i dont know
translation transcription transport and trna are the steps for protein synthesis
mrna carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of a protien
prophase anapahase metaphase telophase
the four major steps involved in protein synthesis is
interphase are starting to make own chromosomes
metaphase getting itself ready to split into two different parts
the ribosomes then start producing this protein
from there the proteins enters the endoplasmic reticulum to be connected and checked for defects
starting with mrna it goes through trna rrna
copyingmutating crossing overreading the cell
once the mrna leaves the nucleus it makes its way through the cell and to the mitocondriton
mrna carries the protein then carries it to trna trna moves binds it
a protien attatches to the mrna and makes a copy of it
the copy is the same sequence but it is the opposite sequence
the sequences then matches up with the amino acids that pair up with each amino acid
the mrna is now a different form of rna
prophaseanaphasemetaphasewhere the cells begins to splitinterphase
the four major steps are interphase prophase anaphase metaphase
prophase is where the parts of the cell move
anaphase is where they break out of the nucleus
metaphase is where the parts of the cell line up in the middle
after mrna leaves the nucleus the next step would be for it to deliver the information it is carrying
the step would be for transcription translation and transcibing
carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of a protein
mrna gives a message to trna that has what amino acids the dna strand has
the trna brings the rna to the dna sequence and the rna lines up with the amino acids
proteins have to move through out the organism for cells and functions to work right
transationtranscriptionsegregationformation of a protein
the trna transfers the code to the rrna on the ribosomes
then it builds a second strand to make the proteins
rrnaressesive mrnamessengertrnatransfer
protein makes you more healthy more stronger good for body more fit
transcription translation dna replication mrna
trna which transfers protein from point a to point b
the major part is amino acids being apart of it and helping us have what we need to survive
mrna leaves the nucleustrna transfers informationsrrna has ribosomes that help rnathen rna is made
first they have to get togethererthen they fix then sell upthen they leave
telophase anaphase prophase metaphase
oxygen keeps things alivesugar keeps them feedcholyplast keeps them movingchloyphllkeeps them awake
the double helix of dna splits up and makes one strand of rna
the mrna takes the copy to the cytoplasm
the trna then takes it and makes a copy of it
when the mrna leaves the nucleus it then goes out and gives the code to something else
that blue print is then taken to the ribosomes to make the protein
the mrna goes to the trna and they come together to make the proteins
after this the rna link together to make dna
trnacopies amino acidssends it back to nucleusshares information
the messenger rna leaves the nucleusthe proccess startsprotein is dividedthe proccess is ended
storing the protein making the protein using the protein and finding the protein
the mrna sends off the code to the mitochondria
step one would be your body produces the protein
step two would be th protein then travels through your blood stream
step three the protein makes more of itself on its way through the body
step four the protein finally reaches where its supposed to be
the four major steps interphase telophase anaphase and prophase
and last the cell goes to the cell nucleotide
those are the four major steps in protein syntheses
mrna changes to amino acids the amino acids sends themselves to trna
the four major steps are prophase metaphase anaphase and telophase
the mrna goes somewhere else where it can copy to make dna
translation the dna is translated into rnatranscription the rna is used in the celltrnarrna grna
first the mrna leaves the nucleus carrying a specific nucleotide
then trna carries nucleotides to an rrna
rrna completes the process with nucleotides coding for a protein
the g phase starts and then it continues on to the s phase
next the s phase turns into the g phase
then the last step is called the g phase
the mrna leaves the nucleus and then goes to the golgi apparatus
it then goes to the lysosomes then finally goes to the nucleus again
in order to do that the mrna takes the information and gets it transfered
after it is replicated the extra that was not needed is gotten rid of
it starts with the mrna leaving the nucleas delivering a message
mrna takes proteins to rrnasends copies to trnadepulicates
it goes from mrna to trna then forms on amino acid
find food to live off offind a new matedrink waterreproduce
they steps are interphase anaphase metaphase and prophase
it goes and gets changed into carbon through the carbon cycle
it goes to trna which takes it to the mitochondira where it is transformed into rna
prophase metaphase interphase anaphase
mrna goes to trna which then goes to rrna goes to grna
mrna takes the info from the nucleus to the trna which then starts the production
then the rrna finishes the production and the grna uses the protien
the transfer the reading of the information the sending of the proteins and recieving
it copys over and over to make more protein then
all the dnas steams are bein put together
your ribosomes would store energy and food
it would store enough for them to require enough energy to make protines
first they would gather energy from the organelles and then use rna to create the protines
mrna leaves the nucleus and goes to the trna
then it goes into the golgi bodies and it is made into rna again
gathering sun light processing proteins dropping unwanted things
four major steps after mrna that invole protein synthesis are the nucleus and the codons are transferred
they also start translation and transport
the protien strand is readthen duplicatedmatched with another then paired into amino acids
trnatransportig it through ribosomerrna helping it through
making protiens and transporting them away
the mrna unwinds and reveals inner chains
new proteins are added and transcription takes place
the proteins are reversed of their old proteins thymine is now adine
the mrna is fixed and winds back up to become a new protein
it separates then replicates after leaving the nucleus
mrna leaves the nucleus then translates onto trna
the codons in the trna each code for a certain type of amino acid
that amino acid creates the necessary protein
the mrna leaves the nucleous and replicates
the replicated mrna is then paired with a base pair that matches up to the end of the sequence
the strand for the rnathe explanations for the rnaand i dont really know the other two
mrna arrives and leaves the sequence from the dna
transportationbrings the nucleus out trascriptioncopies the nucles dnatranslationmake it a code dna can readtransfusiontravels seperately
changing to trnatranslaiting the rnachanging to rrnaproducing protiens in riosomes
ummcopy the strand of rna use bonds the connect the corrasponding nucleotides together
the first step is dna spliting into two single strand rna
the next step is the rna leaving the nucleus
third it must find a copy of another rna to link it with the other
finally the codons are linked and you have a protein
transcription is where they are taken from one place to another for protein synthesis
rna has to fit into holes where dna can not to make protein synthesis
the last way is when dna is made into rna with mrna to make new proteins
when it is made into rna that is making new proteins
once mrna leaves the nucleus then trna does its job
after trna then the rna is almost all the way done with producing protein
after two more steps the rna is done with making the proteins and that is what protein synthesis is
the rna leaves the nucleus and then it goes into the cell membrane
when it is there it then startes to break down and turn into protein
when it is done there the protein then goes throughout the entire cell
its tells what protiens to make and it makes it
the four major steps to involved in protein synthesis are
first transcription takes place where the mrna is copied
after that the ribosomes start making the protein
the first step of protein synthesis is when mrna is sent to a new dna strand
the mrna is then attached to the dna strand
the trna is then sent to the strand and the genetic sequences are transferred
you then have a new strand of dna that is a replicate of the old strand
codons come and break the rnas code down three at a time
the codon takes that code and makes proteins
first mrna leaves the nucleus with the dna sequence
then the mrna meets up with the trna and the trna takes and makes the new strand
then the mrna leaves with the new strand
the final step is that new proteins are made
the mrna takes the rna to trna where they transfer it to dna and back
then they take it to drna where they do something
mrna goes to the dna and makes a copy of the dna
the mrna then gives the information to the trna which delivers the information to the rrna
the rrna then makes the protiens in the ribose of the cell creating new protien
goes to the trna tells it what it needs
the trna combines the protien to copy the mrna brought out of the nuecleous with hydrogen bonds
the rrna takes it out of the cell and places it where it is needed
changing from dna to mrna to trna to grna
metaphase prophase telophase and anaphase
with protein synthesis first the mrna leaves the nucleus
then it travels back to the nucleus as trna and reattaches itself with the mrna
there is a copied strand and a original strand on each of the now two pairs
proteinprotein is let off into the bodyprotein increases the bodies energyprotein causes the body to stay in shape
mrna leaves the nucleus and travels through the cell with the dna information
the dna holds the material necessary for making protein
after passing through the cell the material from the dna is transformed into a protein
mrna attaches to dnadna sequencingamino acids are produced
mrna carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of a protein
after mrna it intervoles into trna then rna than after a period of time it becomes dna
the mrna leave and then sends the material throughout the cell it contains the proteins and amino acids
then it gets sent to trna whish transfers the material
next rrna gets the material and recepts it
mrna leaves the nucleus and goes to the mitochondria
it then is split in parts needed to make the protein
in transcription the mrna is changed into protiens
transcription transition conjugation and trna
leave the cellfind a new cellplant itself in itthen repeat them steps
the mrna leaves the cell and enters the cytoplasm
it carries the information of the cell and for the nucleic acid sequence of a protien
it then reenters the cell and trna begins
the trna attatches to a ribosome and copies the information
while this is happening rrna is producing more ribosomes for the process to happen again
mrnamessenger rnatrnatransfer rnarrnaribose rna
the mrna travels to where ribosomes are created and are tried to match up with the correct sequences
protein synthesis is completed when the mrna leaves the cell
mrna transfers the dna to the ribosomes ribosome makes the protein
it sends the correct instrustions to the nucleus and the nuclus makes the copies and the cycle starts again
rna are whays to dicribe the cell devision
the mrna a will deliver the protein to the trna in wich it will be compied and split apart
the rrna willl then recopy the other part of the srtand
after the mrna leaves the nucleus then ribosomes attach to the endoplasmic reticullum
than it is moved throughout cells to build the protein number back up
the rna leaves the the nucles by exiting the membrane form their the cell wall
prophase metaphase anaphase and telophase
telaphase metaphase anaphase and prophase
gathering distributing using and exiting
the mrna travels to the protien making part of the cell
the protien making part of the cell takes the instructions and makes a protien
the protien is uneque and goes to a part of the body to help
the protien makes a structure with other protiens that oare similar to it
interphaseanaphasemataphaseand prophase
transcriptiontranslationprotein synthesisprotein production
mrna changes to rna which codes to dna and turns in to amino acid
interphase prophase anaphase and telophase
protein blood cells cell wall ribosome and others but i cant remember right now
new dna attaches to both pieces of the dna
another step involves rna but that happenes after the other steps have occured
and mrna is small enough to fit threw the holes thats in a nucleus
anaphase telephase metaphase mitophase
mrna takes protein to dna strand coping it and making new
mrna sends a message to protein wich makes them multiply into more protein
it first has to transfer the rna into codons so that the message will be readable to the parts
next it has to deliver the message to the right place in the cell
it then goes back to recive more messages so that it can transfer the message and start again
the mrna makes another copy of itsself making trna
they have no organism they have no air
the four major steps of protein synthesis is anaphase telophase prophase and interphase
the four major steps of protein synthesis are cell respiration meiosis miosis and cell division
mrna leaves the nucleus and travels to the trna which is also called transport rna
the trna gives the intructions for making the protien
the four major steps in protein synthesis are prophase metaphase anaphase telophase
one the gain energy and the nthey use that energy to build up protein synthesis
it thens to made intop protein and then it goes into protein synthesis
protien takes the mrna and uses it on the body for energy
the mrna has to carry the message that protein synthesis should occur
telophase anaphase metaphase and mitosis
protein synthesis is made up of four major steps
the first is to recieve a message for action
forthly you actually do whatever is needed such as a message sent to another cell or cell group
mrna leaves the nucleusit enters a protein cellit feeds itmrna goes back into nucleus
prophoes metephase annphase ans tellphase
translation which is when the dna spilts and forms a rna strand on the cytoplasm
transcription which is when dna is copied and kept in the nucleus where the process takes place
transformation which is when protiens make a double helix strand of dna
there is also meiosis which is when two cells are split into four dipliod daughter cells
four major steps are that interphase takes place
this is where the cell completely splits
then there is rrna which relays the message to let them know what is happening
there is anaphase which is where the cell starts to divide
it sends messages to the brainmrna tells the body to react to anything importanthelp maintain the cells
it has to be broken down to make the protein sythesis
when mrna leaves the nucleus there are four major steps that are involved in protein synthesis
the first step is when the messenger rna replicates
then the cell divides into two identical daughter cells that both contain the same sequence of rna
the cells then divide one last time and four daughter cells are created
prophase the mrna is prepared for interphase
anaphase the strands are pulled together at the center of the cell
telophase two new daughter rna molecules are formed
the protien is proccesed then it is separted then organized then it is stored
prophase metaphase anaphase and telephase
interphaseprophasemetaphaseanaphasetelophase
four major steps arethem forming things around themthey work togetherthey
the protein gets carried to the necleus
prophase metaphase telophase anaphase
first the mrna has to travel to the other end of the body
then it has to fight off the evil space invaders from the planet cortex
when mrna leaves the nucleus it goes to the trna to deliever a message
then the trna will deliver the protein where it needs to go
brain takes it inthe brain sends out organisms to fight itthe fighters destroy it
then the mrna goes to the lysosomes to produce proteins for the cell to use
it splitsit makes dna it helps make copies travels where needed
the four major steps involved in protein synthesis are the stages of mitosis
step g phasestep sphasestep g phasestep mphase
prophase anaphase metaphase and telophase
the first step is mrna leaving the nucleus
then the coded instructions for creating proteins are translated to trna
next amino acids are produced to make the protein
finally the amino acids are combined to make the protein coded for by the mrna from the nucleus
the protein obsorb energy from the sun it produces sugars proteins are made energy is stored
mrna leaves the nucleus carrying with it the coding recieved from the dna
trna carrying amino acids then mitochondria cytoplasm assembly substances protein
after it gives its message it will gointo the body
mrna gose to the binding site with the insturtctions for building the protien
then trna takes that over to the chromomes and they corss over
then the lysosomes take the protein and keep them with other proteins that have been packaged
it has to change then enitre thing
mrnatranscriptionrnaanabodiescodonstranslationtrna
the mrna copies the dna then it seperates and an amino acid goes through
the last step is that it comes back together
after mrna leaves the nucleus it tells the transport rna to bring nucleotides to the active site for synthesis
proteins and amino acids are also brought to the active site
the messenger rna tells the existing proteins how to make the neccessary new protein and synthesis begins
atp is synthesised and provides energy for the reaction
the protein is then finished and the messenger rna notifies the nucleus of the completion
the mrna leaves the nucleus and goes to the mitochondria
protein is transferredprotein is given a more higher level of itself
makes it strongerprotein then makes its way to the rna to keep healthy
mrna translates the dna adn then slides pass the dna on to the rna delivering the coded information needed
rrna then codes for trna to transfers certain ribosomes to the receptors for the creation of proteins
the mitochondian breaks down the protiens
then it is filtered through the body and into the blood
the protiens are used to supply energy to the body
then goes to another cell and transfers the protein to that cell
then it rides to the nucleus and dumps off the information it is carrying
codons attach to the two new dna strands and match them identical
the two new strands are checked over to insure there were no wrongly placed codons
you can eat alot of healthy foods to get protein
you can excersise everyday and drink alot of water to get protein
you can be in a arobics class to keep track in your protein
mrna leaves the nucleus and ends up at the cytoplasm
it goes through a few steps but i honestly dont know remember them
threw the tubes past the antibodies past the proteins and past the cells
identifictation replication transition synthesis
find anything that shouldnt be there for ex
it protects strengthens distributes and stores proteins to make them more effective and last longer
mrna delivering the instructions to the dna
second they go into anapahase to make the process of making proteins faster
fourth is that the protein comes out and there is a good protein that just got made
first mrna leaves the nucleus to go to get copied
while getting copied they split in half and those halves get identical matchers
now there is two sets of the same protien
the mrna brings instructions to the amino acids
the rrna carries out the instruction with the amino acids
the trna transfers the protein back into the cell through the membrane
it makes a copy of its self like for a new strand because they do have one strand
mrna delivers the plans for the construction of rna
trna brings the various materials for the construction of rna
the mrna the transports information then gains a new half to become dna
afterwords it transports the information to genes
it enters the nucleusit lines up across the center of the nucleusit seperatesit then begins protein synthesis
sends messages to the braingives out informationtells cells what to dodelivers to its destination
the creation developing the protein and sending it out of the nucleus
instuctions come form the nucleas and with amino acids go to build protein with help from the mrna
this happens because of ribosomes acting on the mrna
prophase anaphase telephase metaphase
in the protein synthesis it goies into different steps to be fully developed
the protein has to get every where in the cell body
then the mrna will begin to copy the dna
dna will rejoin into the double helix once more
when the mrna leaves the nucleus it goes through two cells
then the trna comes and make matches with the floting letters
mrna leaves the nuclease and finds a protein
then trna makes a copy of the mrna and sends it out into the cell
the mrna sends a message to tell the body what protein to make
the first major step is intersphase which get the body started
then there is metaphase which brings in the nurtients
next is anaphase which seperates the nutrients
lastly theres propshase which uses up all the proteins and completes the process
the bosy have to boned together ti make sure that it kill off the bad things
the mitochondriachloroplast ribsomes and protein
interphase telophase prophase and anaphase
first it tells what is happening to the golgi apparatusit goes to mrna to try and find the protein synthisis
mrna leaves the nucleus to collect data and brings it back into the cell
following this step the trna transfers the dna onto the replication
ribosomes hold the replica into place as it transfers
mrna leaves the nucleusit transfers all of the protienmaking instructions to the other parts of the body
then the body makes a new starnd of rna
mrna tranfers to trna and that tranfers to rrna which transfers to grna
it goes through the cytoplasm then into the cell membrane
after that it goes through a process and then it goes out of the cell
the mrna transports messages through out the body to perform protien synthesis
the body then performs protien synthesis
the first step is trnathe second step is rrnathe third step is mrnathe last step is grna
four major steps are crossing over movement mitosis and meiosis
one would be er that attach to ribsomes which produce proteins and proteins help your body
after the amino acids are made proteins are made
four major steps involved in protein synthesis is
the first major step is transcription of mrna
the mrna leaves the nucleusthe mrna tells the stuff where to goit goes therethe stuff gets there
copy and moltuply to make more rna or dna
mrna leaves the nucleus then your protein comes in
after that your cells divide and then they go to yuor membrane
it goes through the chain and then goes throuth the atp synthase then it comes out of the transport chain
after the mrna leaves the nucles it goes through four major steps involved with protein synthesis
firts it goes through transcription and is changed into dna
first the trna carries the mrna from the nucleus to the lysosomes
then the lysosomes follow the instructions on the mrna to make amino acids
after the amino acids are made they form together to form a protein
the the protein is released into the endoplasmic reticulum and the process starts all over again
after that it is transfered to the rna strain which is turned into the last form
it leaves and goes back to the nuclueus and creates the correct proteins with the codons it has
mrna leaves oxygen enters water enters protein is synthesised
mrna changes to trna and travels through the golgi apparatus
the mitochondria absorbs the sun light to create food
the acgu is a thing that has rna for the telephase
it gets the message from the brian n takes it to its distenation
the first step is that the protien unzips the mrna
the next step is that it takes out any kind of trash that it may have
next the protien comes back and zips it back up
the last step is that it sends it back from the nucleus to the cytoplasm
when mrna leaves the nucleus it travels st to the mitocondria
after that it goes to be bonded with amino acids and lastly it is changed into protein
the mrna gets transformed into another type of rna
that new rna is use to make genetic information
that strand of genetic information gets a complementary strand
both of the strands get paired up and they make a segment of dna
the mrna hookes up to the dna to make a protein
the mrna gives information to the nucleus
the protein is formed from this information
mrna to give the instructions on how to make the protiens
trna to transfer the protien molecules rrna for ribosomes to help make the protien
it leaves the nucleus and then goes trhough the ionic channels
the mrna transcribes then translates and later forms protiens
ribosomes link proteins together to make a protein chain
the mrna unzips the mrna changes thymine into uracilthe mrna changes its structure the mrna zips back up
the four major steps are dna proteins ribrosomes and lysomoes
the proteins are part of the process and the ribrosomes are what helps it too leave the nucleus
the lysomoes are what helps to keep it in the nucleus
it starts with mrna then goes to trna then grna and finally rrna
four major steps that are involved with protein sythesis are prophase metaphaseinterphaseand annaphase
these work to send dna and such in different places
they recieve and take care of whats sent by mrna and trna
the mrna transports messages to the brain
prophase anapase metaphase and telophase are the four
the mrna carries instructions for the amino acid sequence for the proteins
gproteins head to where they have to gointerphaseproteins reach destinationgproteins seek out problemgproteins work and fix the problem
carries from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence
trna trasnslats the thing it to what it is
you build up protien your body is healthy you lose wieght and you feel good
after it leaves the mrna then it starts duplicating and making more and more proteins
the mrna leaves the nucleus to begin protein synthesis
the mrna then is transferred using trna
the last step of potein synthesis is it leaving the body
during mrna it leaves the nucleus and goes into the blood stream
after they replicate one set of the genetic information goes back into the blood stream
this action is completed in just seconds
anaphase metaphase prophase and telophase
the mrna tells some other rna to make some protein
then at that place it makes some protein
trna carries instructions from the nucleus to the amino acid sequence of the protein
leaving coming back together reproducing and repeating
protein helps strengthen your bodyit protects your bodyproteins are stable
a protein a attches to a chromosome and gets around
there is prophase metaphase anaphase and telephase
then the rrna remembers the sequence and sends it to the dna
mrna goes to the dna and then travels to the ribose
helping maintain synthesismaking sure proteins are are leaving the nucleus at a resonable time
clearing any unnescary findings before the process
trna transfers cells mrna messangerrrnagrna
the protein is what most of the mrna is
messenger rna is transcribed during transcription
the steps are propshase telopshase metophase and anaphase
it leaves the rna strand and then moves to the cell
the mrna carries the information to the nucleus
the rna will break off and attach a new strand onto the trna
starting with mrna leaving the nucleus one step involved in protein synthesis would be speclization
golgi apparus which store and packages proteins
it starts the process of making a new protein strand
it finds which protein it needs for the strand
trna takes the stuff from the nucleus to where it needs to go
mrna has to get settled in somewhere and be able to function
then it gets more sugars to multiply the strands
mrna then has to go through mitosis and last it creates proteins
it carries instructions from the nucleus containing information about the sequence of amino acids of a protein
this also carries amino acid sequences to the proteins so they can produce or use them for energy
the protein begins to synthesizeit makes new onesit makes some kind of foodi have no clue
from the reproduction there are more cells now
the cells attaches on to another strand and starts the cycle again
once mrna leaves the nucleus rna transcription occurs
after this dna can be made so dna replication occurs
then proteins combine with nucleic acids to make dna sequences for the new dna
the synthesis will start to pull apart then it will split into two
it will then pull apart than start all over again
after mrna leaves the nucleus it codes for
well the messenger rna or mrna leaves the nucleus to make protein synthesis
they have to diffuse out of the nucleus
then the transfer rna or trna will take the rna to make the protein synthesis
protein arrives at mrnaproteins get ready to get copiedpotein gets copiedprotein leaves mrna
after that it connects with amino acids
mrnarrna ribosome grnagenetrnatransfer
it just multiplies and then that means there is more and new dna
the mrna gets other amino acides to combine with the rna
it comes in contact with another nucleus
mrna goes and delivers the message of dna
the split dna is then put together with another strand of dna
mrna and protein syntheses are the main part
the mrna transforms they show up evolve with othersthe mrna idk
mrna transfers the sequences of amino acids to trna
from trna it is translated back to dna for a new protein to be created
mrna leaves the nucleus for the ameno acids then it transfers to trna and is transformed to protein
transperation when the mrna leaves the nucleusrestoration when the mrna enter the mitocondria
well first it leaves the mrna then it connicts to the dna
mutation homeostasis cell division and cell mutation
they leave the nucleousthey bypass all organismsgain more cellstrapped in the cell wall
the mrna moves out of the nucleus mrna then goes to the autosome
you eat the protein so u can get strong
it helps you grow strongh bones so when you get older you can lift heavy objects
anaphase metaphase prophase and telaphase
anaphase metaphase telophase and prophase
aniphasetelephasemetephase and prophase
then the trna will transcribe the message
the protein will leave the nucleus and go out into the cell
the protein is given a specific job to do after it leaves the nucleus
the protein does this job after it leaves the nucleus
next the protein will code for different things
then the protein will help the cell function right
the mrna is also known as the messenger rna
the trna transfers the new code to the right sequence
protien synthesis begins with the cytoplasm going toward the ribosome
the mrna starts off at the nucleusthe mrna delivers the message about the proteins
leaving the mrna it become a rnamrna is a cellmrna is a cell membrainmrna is a single cell
the body begins to make a new cell with the same strand
the cell is being made to the exact specifications of the old strand
the messanger rna takes the message from the dna and takes it to the nuclues and connects to make chromosomes
beginning with mrna then becoming trnathen codingfinally the cell knows what to code for the proteins
after mrna leaves the nucleus trna transfers the proteins to the er
after this rrna takes it from the ribosome and then the protein is sent it off into the cell
mrna leaves the nucleus wth the instruction to bulid a protien
the mrna goes to the mitochondrion and tells the transfer rna what to do
the trna then goes and gets what is needed and brings it to the cell
the rrna finishes off the rna sequence with the missing pieces that the trna brought
the four major steps involed in protein synthesis are carbohydrates amino acids fat sugar
goes to find more protiensfinds foodprotects
anaphaseintrphasemetaphaseand prophase are the four steps needed to for the synthesis
when mrna leaves the nucleus trna transfers information to the nucleus and translation occurs
the amino acids are then read and are distributed
transcription splits the amino acids and rrna makes the new protein
mrna leaves the nucleus travels into the gogi body out the anus into the enviroment
anaphase the parent cell is going through a process of division
metaphase the dividing cells begin to form their makeups
telephase the cells have split from the parent
the mrna unzips and the base pairs are switched
t then turns to a g turns to c c turns to g and a turns to u
trna is created rrna is created then trna and rrna bring the new info
then they start telling the rna what to do
next they keep transfering the mrna through the body and last they transfer the trna
prophase metophase anaphase telophase
then last it is changed and the rna is ready to go
mrna tells the mitochondria to use sugars and make food enzymes along with oxygen
mrna leaving the nulceus dna coming insidecompound bonds get togetherbonds are in one and kill diseases chemical bonds are formed
it travels through to other cells to the nucleaus
transcriptioninitiationmutationprotation
proteins are half way developedproteins are developed
the protein helps your body build and stay strong
mrna leaves the nucleus with the dna information because dna cant leave the nucleus
mrna collects the information from the dna and leaves the nucleous
the oxygen moves through the cell to the nucleus
the oxygen is then mixed with atp and sent to the er
then the atp is turned into adp to then make more atp
ummmrna leaves the nucluesdna returns to nucleusribosomes appearthey make the proteins
the rrna has the trna transfer this code into a set code for a new protein
finally protein production occurs where the protein is synthesized to match the original code for the dna
strands of cells cell regenaration cell chromasomes the food supplies
th protein starts in your cells then entering your bloodstream
it use prophase metaphase anaphase and telophase
in prophase the chromosomes begin to develop chromatids
they are then attatched to the centromere
the chromosomes finish their attatchment and line up at the center
the next stage is anaphase where the centromere splits and each centromere goes to a pole
in telophase the cell then slpits in half to form two cells
the dna has the code and gives it to the mrnathe trna gets the code and decodes it
the code is decoded by the trnathe message is carried out to the chromosomes
mrna carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of a protein
four major steps in protein synthesis are
preparedsynthesizingsythensizedenergy usage
living in the envorment to survle the envorment to have a nuff to eat
mrna it sends the message to the cells stating the problemrrnareplicates the cellstrnatransfers the messagegrnagets all of them together
sending messages to the whole cell transfuring translating and making proteins with the ribosomes
copies the mrna firstthen transfers itit then codes againand repeats the process
dna uses the intructions to build genteic code
then it goes to a strand of dna and attaches to it
then the cell stores the proteins and uses them
it takes it to whatever place it goes then takes it to all of the other rnas
the golgi apparatus regulates the movement of substances across the cell membrane
the endoplasmic reticulum helps to regulate the movement of substances across the cell membrane as well
the structure og the cells is the sameliving cells come from another living cell
respirationmovement of foods and protiens in and out of the cell
the postion of the cell sometimes wont let the cell move
the procees of the cell will stay in one place until its procees is complet
first they decide if the substances is good or bad
they insepct the substances by telling if its a protein or a diease
secound they elimanate the bad substances
if the substance is good they let it go throw
third they ship or store some of the protiens
all cells are livingsome cells make other cells
transportation so the cell can move particles across the plasma membranehomeostacis so the cell can do its job normally
the membrane is permeable which allows smaller cells to go through
membranes have cells that create openings for larger cells
anaphase cells splittelophase cells start to splitprophase nuclear membrain dissapers
the parts of a cell are held together by the cytoplasm and membrane
this does not allow for foreign things to be able to penetrate the cell
osmosis is used to move molecules across the cells permiable membrane
also the protein carriers to determine what can move through or across the membrane
equilbrium of substances from higt to low concertrion diffusion the excreation of water and waste from the cell
trna is a movement of a type of cell across the cell membrane
three processes are when the cell usese other cells the use of cilai and flagilia
they osmosis the substances need to be small so they can pass through the membrane
lastly in diffusion they difuse into the cell
cells use the process of diffusion to take in the substances
the protiens in the plasma membrane change their shape to carry substances throught the membrane and into the cell
osmosis also brings substances into the cell by bringing them in through the water around the cell
active transport inactive transport and escort transport
the cell uses the er to move things throughout the cell
the cells movement is controlled by the cell membrane
it controls what comes into the cell and what leaves the cell
although the nucleus controls the cell and tells it to move the membrane does most of the work
cells use diffusion to transfer water across the membrane
they also use protien holes to move the larger substances
some things that they move across simply pass through the membrane
the cell can control the membrane cause its part of the cell
the cytoplasm which caries it on the substance
cells have protective layers that could prevent harmful substances from entering throug the cell membrane
osmosis balancing water levelsdiffusion of cell materialsmrna leaving the nucleus
the cell can move because of the nucleus
the nucleous tells the mitocontria to send a signal to the cell membrane
the cell membrane gets the message and tells the cytoplasm to start to push things around
after that everything gets moved into place
the movement of substances has to make its way through the cell membrane
the membrane only allowes a few people to go at a time
use of the membrane of the cell helps create movement
active transport facilitated diffusion and osmosis
one is by moving the cell away from harmful areas
another is moving the harmful stuff from the cell and bringing in the good stuff
lastly the cell can move its self to places where it can get more food or water etc
the cell slide through the membrane then the cell breaks into piecsand the cell eats
nerve cells tell the membrane where it is and the membrane uses that imformation to move it
the golgi aperatis acts as the bodies ups man to transport materialflagela is used by certain organisms to move
the flagellum protects and moves the cell
reproduction respiratin and food gatherinmg
they dont let anything enter the cell membrane
another way is if there is more liquid in the cell water will leave the cell
these three all help control the movement of substances across the cell membrane
nuclear envelope it is used to take waste out of the celllysosomes
they can control them they can redirect them and they can get rid of them
one processe used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane would be cell reprodution
over time the cells change an take different forms
cell diffusion cell respiration and cell exertion
the third way is by letting it be filtered while it goes through the body
theres also spots were things can get through the cell but it requires more energy then diffusion
and the cell can just allow something in side it
it uses the energy from the membrane
it only makes the trip maybe three times
they use the a chemical proccess of enzymes the membrain also and through channels in the membrain
three processes that cells use to control movement across the cell membrane are proteins phospholipids and vesicles
the substances hook on to the protein and are transfered into the cell
with phospholipids the substance is absorbed and goes through the membrane into the cell
vesicles form around the substance and carry it into the cell
the cell wall blocks and keeps substances from crossing into the membrane
cells use ribosomes mitochondria and lysosomes to move substances across the cell
mitchondria are the powerhouse and provide energy
lysosomes which come from the golgi apparatus carry out sugars
these three processes are pushing where the cell pushes the substance crossing the membrane
resirpation helpts it eat and drinkwalk help it move also
meosis is one way that cells move substances
mitosis is another way that cells move substances
the last way that a cell moves substances is telephase
osmosis mitosis diffusion the movement of water in and out of the cell
electric currents through the spinal cord going directly to the brain
the cell could not be able to move at allthe cell could move across the cell membrane
nucleus cell wall the microondran
cell wall only lets some stuff throughgolgi aparatus controls waste
diffusion of a substance with in a cell
passive transportactive transoprtdiffusion
diffusion is the movement of water over cells
meiosis is the process in which a substance moves over cell membrane for a short period of time
the cell membrane only lets certain things across the membrane
three processes are mitochondrian lysosomes
three processes to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are the nucleus flagellum and ribosomes
one way is the golgi apparatus another is mitochondria and the third is mrna
they are passed through various organelles
dna translated to rna translated to protiens
cell use of the process called photosynthesis
they help them movethe are a celll in a membraneand they control the movement of substances
diffussion is random movement across a cell membrane
first the organism takes in the food then it breaks it down finall decomposure takes place
one cell controls the movementone cell controls figellaone cell the celius moves the cell
they start from one part of the body and move too the given area they need
one way to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is prophase menaphese and telephase
when molecules are added to a cell they grow wider
when molecules leave the cell this is called hypertonic
and when molecules pass through a barrier in the cell this is called osmosis
some process can be used to move the substances across the cell membrane
one of the three proccesses is when the cells travel through the blood flow
one process is the use of the flagellum
it is used like a whip to move things from one place to the other
another process is the cell puts a protien in a bubble like structure to move it through the cytoplasm
also a cell uses a protien to move things around
to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane flagellum cilium and carrier proteins are used
flagellum are long whiplike structures used for movement
flagellas is a tail that allows the cell to swim around
and little tenticles on outside of cell to help swim around
reconizing the celllets out emzymes to attack
the cell membrain is used to let things in and out of the cell
the nucleus is the brain of the cell and controlls where it goes
the genes inside of the cell can tell where each cell go
the cells have channels the cell wall controls what can come in and what can go out
the channels take the subtances to different parts of the cell
they confront it to see if its a bad substance or a good one
if its a good substance it will adapt to it
the three process of dna are mrna trna and grna
the cell splits up to a sister as they call itmiosis
the cell membrane is used to protect the cell
the cell wall is used to block any harmful things out
the processes are active transport diffusion and passive transport
the second peice of protection is the cell membranewhich also helps filture the things coming and going
the cell membrane controls what goes in and what goes out of the cell
sometimes there are spaces in the membrane allowing tiny things to get through it
the cell membrane can only let certain things in and out of the cells
the first process is miosisthe second is
they combined with eachother ta make a bigger cell
the nucleus is the one that tells the other cell parts what to do
so it gives the order then the ribosomes transport the substance out of the nucleus
the cell uses the mitochondria to move substances
the cell uses the reticulums to move substances also
they control regulation by having little holes that let substances through substance that are to big are not aloud through
they control the movement of substances across the cell membrane by
the cells control the movement of substances across the cell membrane because they control the blodd flow
the cell uses the flagellum to move easier the move easier throught the cell
the cell also uses it cell wall in order to keep the substances in the cell
the third process the cell uses is its nucleus to control the cell
ingulf or eating food absorbtion asorbing waste removal
there are a few processes used by cells to control the movement of the substances across the cell
three examples include homeostasis diffusion and meiosis
the other things they use is a cell wall of course only in plant cells
defusion is one way another would osmoses and i do not know a third
they are connected to the membrane so that they can controll movement
they use the cell membrane to transport certain types of things into and outside the cell
they can use the cytoplasm inside to halp also move things
they use proteins to transport thing around the cell
osmosis the equilzation of water in and outside the cell
organelles which prevent unessesary functions
the cells carry subtances along the membrane to other places in the body
they also use their platelets to stop things
all three of the processes help control movement
mrna also helps transfer dna across the membrane to amino acids in protein
golgi bodies for packaging waste products
lysosomes used to eat away at the wastes
blood clots that way the blood wont get out of control
they block other organisms from entering the cell membrane
they help build a wall to keep things out
they fight off any bacteria or anything they dont want on the cells membrane
photosynethsis helps a plant survivecell splilting to make two cellsbreathing
the cell membrane moves substances near the nucleaus
as new cells form the membrane starts to multiply as the cells do
active transport help ot go from cell to cell and get its protein
inactive transportdoes not help it get its protein adn reproducediffusionuses energy to help the plantscells grow
they do all of that so that the cell can function
polar heads face out inside and outside of the cell membrane because there is water on both sides
nonpolar tails are smooshed in between the polar heads so they dont touch water
one process used by cells to control movement of substances across the cell membrans is the cell wall
active transportfacilated diffusion simple diffusion
the purpose of the membrane is to help pass over the stuff your body takes in or needs
it separates the good stuff and the bad
they have flagella to help them move the substances across the cell membrane
the cell membrane also chooses if the bacteria or substance can enter
the cells absorb it and carry it to where it has to go
the cell flows with it to make it go where it has to go
theyve got the cell wall so not everything can come in or out
the cells allows what goes into the membrane
the cells allow what goes out of the membrane
it controls how the membrane allows the cell to reproduce
well they can move they reproduce and they have some crazy thing called a cell wall
osmosis is the passing of things across a membrane
the membrane will split som that certain substances can pass through
cell wall it prevents things from coming in and going out
ribosomes mitochondria and the nucleus
they have the same cells so they can move from place to place
the cytoplasm moves the ribosome around in the cell
the endoplasmic reticulum moves the ribosomes into the nucleus
the golgi apparatus removes the unwanted substances out of the cell
mitchondriadouble the cellcell wall control what come in and out
the nucleus holds all the dna and controls the cells functions
the proteins help control what passes through the cell membrane
the cell membrane also determines what comes in and out of the cell
absorbing nutrients cells must absorb nutrients in order to live
producing offspring they must also reproduce to not become extinct
adapting to natural habitats cells must be able to be comfortable where they lie in order to survive
they must be familiar with it and know how to live in it
one is the protein channel and it helps control how much of that substance goes through
two is the cell membrane which tells the substace where to go and how much of it to go
three is the mitochondria it also tells how much subtance goes where and how much of it
the movemnets of substances acrosss the cell membrane flow through the blood streams
metaphase slows it down to create the processtelaphasespeeds it up to create the process
there is the cell wall that only lets wanted materials pass
then there is the cytoplasm that will capturesomething unwanted and get rid of it
it will have to go into phases reproduce
photosynthisisresperationdigestion
your brain tells your body to do things and your body does them
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances acrosss the cell membrane are
a cell wall controls what enters and exits a cell
cells move across the membrane with the use of osmosis diffusion and homostasis
osmosis is when the cell determines what is and is not allowed to cross the cell membrane
homostasis is when the cell is both equally stable on the inside and outside of the cell
diffusion is when molecules are entering and leaving the cell
three processes that are udes by the cell to move substances across the cell membrane are the cell wall
they use mrna to carry messages to the mitochondria and the cell somehow use that message or energy
mrna carries messages from the nucleus to other organstrna transports dna to places with in the cellrrna
cells divide carry oxygen to the brain deliver nutrents
this is movient control and by call across
the nucleus help with gathering substances
also the ribsomes help keep them moving
the chromotids help keep track of where everything is
cell membranes that allow enzymes to move across the cell
the nucleaus that controls all the chemical processes in the cell to maintain homeostasis
the cell wall that allows only certain enzymes to enter and exit the cell
cellular respiration the respiration of cellscell division the dividing of cellscell frequencies frequency of cells
with their bodys through blood and organs
the cell membrane uses everything in the cell to control what moves threw out the cell
it controls the movment of your body movmentit helps you thinkit hels the cell membrane understand
osmosis is the movement with waterdiffusion transports materials through the memebranefacilitated diffusion
it moves around the cell getting information where it needs to go
the cells us enzymes amino acids and chromosomes
it sends signs to allow that cell to cross over
then it seems that the cells can reproduce
slow the movement down they also can totally stop moving ment or they can let it go right through
the cell membrane controls the traffic from one side to another side of the membrane
passive transportationactive transportationdiffusion
the flagellim is used to cause the organism to move about
the cell uses it little fingers to move things across the surface
mutation transcription and translation are three processes
the substancs is put in to the golgi and packaged then put through protine and passed through the cell wall
the cells in the plasma are controlled by the current within the cell
then the nucleus opens and lets cell through
cells travel through the human body when they are needed
it only takes a matter of seconds for them to get to where they are needed
there are anti bodies and white blood cells are fighting it off
the cytoplasm moves substances around the cell
the cell also uses protein synthesis to move proteins around the cell
they move from one place to another they all go to the human body they go threw the blood vessal
they can go through doors called channel protein
they can insert their key proetin to unlock the cell membrane in order to pass through
they can be transported out of the cell by the organelles
one of the proccesses is the cell wall that blocks anything from getting to the inside
they use the mitochondria to send messages
protiens control what goes out and in the cell
they let things in through holes along the membrane only let what it needs in and out through
cells can move substances across the cell membrane by diffusion
water diffuses through the cell membrane
oxygen profusion oxygen profuses through the air over the celll membrane
cellular diffusion the substance diffuses through the cell membrane
convection the substance goes through the cell membrane
in reproduction the cell produces offspring
storing energy requires the cell to become more active
movement requires the cell to adapt to different places in the cell
one way is the orgenes move itthere is searten parts of the cell that let it out
they enter through openings in the cell membrane
there they are moved throughout the cell membrane through tubes
finally they reach an opening and are released where they need to go
removes waist takes in martierials and
active transport moves materials across the membranediffusion substances link with proteins to move across the membrane
the first process is to move it to the mitochdaine
the final movement they make is to the cell membrane
they send out messagesthey work togetherthey dont eat each other
these are hairlike structures on the outside of the cell
the last way is the psudopod or false foot
the cell sends out a part of itself and the rest follows
cell diffusion keep some cells form moving out of the membrane
a cell consist of many parts to protect things from getting in
the cell membrane acts like an outer lining to protect the cell from harmful things getting in
the final part is the cell wall found only in plants
this allowes a double protection feature to be sure things dont get in
diffusionthe process by which water moves across the semipermeable membrane
active and passive transport moves substances across the membrane
mrnamessenger rna that delivers information to other cellstrnatranscript rna that writes the information for the mrnarrna
the cell membrane controls how substances move across the cell
the nuclear poresthe nucleuspremeable acceptable
the cell membrane regulates movement in and out of the cell by monitoring what passes through
in eukaryotic cells cell regulation can be monitored by the removal of introns
cells use diffusion osmosis and facilitated diffusion to move susbstances across the membrane
diffusion and osmosis are types of passive transport
on the other hand facilitated diffusion is a type of active transport
passive transport is when the substance can move freely through the cell membrane
increase surface areaincrease of wieghtdecrease of mass
they allow what they want to enter the cell
they allow what they dont want to exit the cell
the cell membrane of the cell can help it move
the nucleus of the cell can determine wether the cell can move
the cell membrane determines what can enter the cell and what can not
lysosomes act ike janitors for the cells and remove waste
the cell membrane is made up of proteins and carbohydrates
they can use atp the takes energy to move them from place to place
cells also use marker proteins so other cells can read where they are needed to do a job
cilia are little hair like structures that help the cell or organsim move and protect it
though a small opening that only aloows certain thing to come in
pushing and using enegry to get though the cell membrane
osmosis passive transports and active transports
cells move through out the membrane for blood
they gather protin from out sidethey keep moving from one place to anotherit all process the membrane
they go to where their function is needed
they go along where the substances are supposed to be
they get carried out of the area into a new one
the three mitocondria amino acids and dna
the second process is the ribosomes because it can not go past the cell membrane
there is active transport passisve transport and diffusion
they use plasma ribosomes and mitochondrea
active transport passive transport and osmosis
it only allows things through that it recognizes
some things have special entrances to the cell
cells use vesicles transport chains and protiens to control the movement of subsatnces across the cell membrane
vesicles eat and digest unwanted or wasted substances
when the vesicle dies so does the celltransport chains carry many things across the cell
they open and have the particles attatch to them
they then close and open up on the opposite side
this way things that should not go into the cell are not let in or out
when an emzyne csuch as insulin attaches to a cell it tells the cell to let in sugar
photosynthesis creattion of food for cell imersion material going inexpulsion material going out
the plasma membrane will only let certain things in and out of the cell through
three movements are flushing out bursting vacoules and breakdown of the cell
cellular division cellular respiration cellular reproduction
one process is the mitocondria which starts the movement of the cell across the membrane
another process is the rough er which keeps the cell moving across the membrane
the last process is the nucleus while is the distination of the moving cell
transcriptionis when the mrna turns into amino acidstransferis when the dna is transfered into mrna
facilitated diffusionactive transportpassive transport
osmosisuses water to move substances from high to lowdiifusion
flagellum is a tail like structure that helps the cells move
sprilla are tail like structures all over that help it move more quickly
coci is a movement that the cell uses to move all around
the cells nucules controlls the whole cell and every thing in it
the things that are not needed in a cell are removed by the endoplasmic rectilium
messenger rna carries things through the cell
the cell wall keeps unwanted things from coming in and across the cell membrane
the three processes are diffusion cell movement and also cell mutation
cells use cilia fagella and sutopods to move things across the membrane
one of these ways is by the cell membrane
this organelle moves and allowes acces for food for the cell
cell membranethe outer oart of the organismcell wallprotects the organism and anthitng entering and leavingnucleushelps the organisms function
replicationreproduction of the cellsmrna it take the dna to replicate itgenetics it makes up what we are
the to enter the cell you have to use atp energy
cells can control which amino acid strains pass through the membrane as directed by the nucleus of that cell
difffusion osmosis and protein carriers
cells use diffusion to move subtstances across the membrane and obtain equilibrium
one way is by using cilia to move substances across the membrane with small hairlike apendages
another way is to use flagella long whiplike apendages used to move substances across the cell membrane
one more way to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is by releasing ribosomes
interphase substances entermetaphase nutrients are collectedanaphase unneccessary substances leave
cells transport energy across the membrane
diffusion crossing over active diffusion
transportation they move all around the placethey soak up nutrientsthey have have ribomsomes they collect enyzymes
the processes cells use is translation transcription and diffusion
the cell can enter the cell through diffusion
exocytosismovement of substances out of a cellendocytosismovement of substances into a cellsolute pumpmoving substances in and out of cell
they move by useing little hairs on them
they use there membrains to control there movement
they move when they are need by the membrain
the three processes are replication transcription and translation
they use the cell mebrain to move from place to placethey can use the flow of water
the cell membrane creates a barrier for all things entering or exiting the cell
the golgi body works as a pack mule to move proteins throughout the cell
the cilia or flagella are fingerlike structures used to move objects
how much water gets in the cellit lets oxygen in
it helps the cells move it also helps take out bad baccterrai
they use their tail for movementproteinsnucleus
some cells use the cell wall as a barrier to allow or block certain sustances from coming in
other cells may use osmosis as a means of transporting or disposing of certain sustances
mrna carries out messages throughout the celltrna transfers energies throughout the cellrrna reproduces
cells change prokaryotesprotects nucleuscirculates other cells
there is active transport passive transport and something else
reproduction cellular communication cellular reproduction
exocytosis a process by which materials are moved out of a cell
endocytosis a process by which materials are moved into a cell
it is a passive transport and an example is a sodiumpotassium pump
diffusion and osmosis are two types of movement of substances across a cell membrane
osmosis is used to slide over the membrane
the nuclius is the brain of the cell that controls everything
the vacuol takes all unessisary wast and bacteria out of the cell
the mitocondrian surve to maximize cellular reperation by increasing cellular communication
endocytosismoving materials into the cellexcocytosismoving material out of the cellsodiumpotassium pump
one would be by using the flagelum beause it helps to give movement
there is osmosis homeostasis and diffusion across a cell memebrane
homeostasis helps control the temperature of the cells by knowing how much fluid needs to be in a cell
osmosis is the process of how much fluid or water is needed inside of a cell
diffusion across a cell membrane is where it only lets in certain chemicals that the body needs
it lets out the water and other fluid inside a cell
the er the nucleus and the cytoplasm
three processes that control the movement across a cell membrane is the sugar ribose and a phosphate
one thing they do is keep certain things that the cell wants in or out
this is done by a gate like strycture on the surface od the membrane
this mainly allows almost all things to get in and certain things to get out
glycolysis is anaerobic meaning that it does not require oxygen
osmosis is the taking in and removing wastes or materials from the cell
diffusion is the movement of water across a cell may have to deal with a hypertonic or hypotonic solution
active transport passive transport and
thirdly there are organisms inside and outside the cell that control the flow of food
passive transport is to help the cells to move throughout the cells
active transport is the transport that is always active and moving
keeps foreign organisms out of the cell
the substance would be used up again after the first time
cell growth cell division replication
the golgi apparatus acts as a transportation system of protiens in a cell by importing and exporting the proteins
the ribosomes are protein builders in the cell and the endoplasmic reticulum controls what proteins the cell keeps
the cell uses osmosis and facilitated diffusion to move substances across the cell membrane
one process is that the cells use their functions to move substances
two is that differnet organelles help the cells move the substances
and the third is that the cells guide the substances to their destination
control the membrane control its movements
the cell membrane determines what go into the cell and what leaves the cell
finaly there are proteins on the inside of the cell which can stop anything from getting into the cell
the process is called energy transport chain
flagella makes sure everything moves properly in the cell
one process that the cell uses to control movment of substances across the cell membrane is by osmosis
another procces is faciliated diffusion
the last process of movement of substances across the cell membrane is diffusion
the cell has a cell wall the controls what comes in and what comes out of the cell
the first is osmosis where a liquid moves through the cell membrane by the process of diffusion
filtering what enters and leaves the membrane and protection
meiosis mitosis lysosomethey all control what is going on inside of a cell
they use nuclear envelope which is the processing center of the cell
ribosomes which are around cell membrane and chromosomes that are around the cell membrane too
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are mitosis and meiosis
the cell uses the chloroplast to move things quickly and efficently
they also use the cell wall to keep things in so they cant loose anything
the membrane tells everything where it needs to be and where to go
waste removal waste is removed from the cell
spongelike surface selectively lets things in and out of the cell
the cell membrame the nucleus and the cell wall
the nuclues controls all of the actions
they are mitosis meosis and the other one i dont know
one process used by cells to control the movement of a substance is that the nucleous
the cell membrane lets things inprotein picks up the sustance and moves it aroundthe substance floats in the cellmembrane
cell wall blocks particlescell membrance controls the what goes in and what comes outcytoplasm helps decide
respration it helps it to move more and faster
cells controll the movement of substances across the cell by reducing what they allow out of the cell
the celll membrain to tell it what to do
the plasma membrane helps control what crosses the cell membrane
the nuclear membrane controls what crosses the cell membrane
diffusion helps control how much fluid crosses the cell membrane
osmosis helps control what substances cross the cell membrane
diffusion selective permiabilty and osmosis
they have a cell wall which protects anything from getting in and anything going out
they have organelles to break down proteins and get the waste out of cells
cells also have mitochondria that increase its surface area to add more respiration to the cell
they are what makes everything happen in our body
the three movements are anaophase telophase and peolphase
to keep there cell in the same shapeto find foodto keep diffrent bacteria out of people system
the cell membrane protects the cell from anything that the cell would not like inside of it
the rna that packages the proteins and messanger r that delivers the packaged protein
cells move protien to every part of your body
there are millions of cells in your body working to fight iff infectioncells help keep you healthy
the nucleus sends out a message to the rest of the cell and the cell moves
the flagellum is used to help the cell move around and move it can move other organisms
it moves by the way the chromatids attach to the substances
it also moves by the nucleus drawing it closer to it
it also moves by the ribosomes that help the chromatids move it
process one nuclear envelope and pores allow things to travel in and out of the nucleus
three processes the cell does is hypertension and hypotension
homeostasisit controls the temperature of the cell to help it survive
the chromosomes help move things acroos the cell the chemicals and the substanes in the cell help move
one is the ability to reproduce so quickly
two the rate at which and finaly they are very hard to extinct
the cell uses different types of proteins such as transport protein to decide what comes in or out
they cell can uses moving organelles such as a flagella to move to keep things from entering
it has a double phosolipid bilayer to keep items from just coming in
the cell preforms trna and mrna across the cell membrance
cells reproduce and make fertile offspring
osmosisactive transport and facilitated disfusion
diffusion is the movement of solid substances across the cell membrane
moving from the golgi bodies to the cell wall by visicles is one way
taking ribosomes from the rough er to the golgi bodies is another
mitosis could be another way of movement
first it enters from the contractile vacoule and moves across the cell through the cytoplasm
it enters out of the cytoplasm into the endoplasmic reticulum to remove waste
they can send out blood cells to slow it down they can also send out white blood cells
they move from one structure in the organism to another
mitochdiran store foodmembrane help against bad stuff
they move through the blood stream into the membrane
by controling the receptor proteinsmaking jelly preservesworshipping satan
there is transition translation and transcription
passive transport is when they go with the gradient
active transport is when they go against the gradient
diffusion is the moving of water molecules throughout the cell
blood vescles send blood through the body
the immune system uses white blood cells to block off bacteria
transports information throughout the body
three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances arelipidsmitochondria
mitosisthe addition of more proteinsthe cell cyclethis helps regulate what is going onchemosynthesisthis helps it adapt to the changing environment
the processes used by the cells are osmosis facilitated transport and active transport
things can get in and out from passive transportthings can get in and out from active transport
they open and close membranethey allow food and water come inthey let waste leave the cell
the cell transfers oxygen to the organs
it moves nutrients to other parts of the body
photosynthesis to absorb light form the sun
protien channel lets materials in and outreceptor protiens are like name tagsrecognition protiens determine when there is an intruder
the proteins would sit on the membrane and shoot particles through
phagocytosis a cell will eat another cell
respiration what cells use to livereproduction devolopement of new celltranslocation moved to different place about the cell
some cells use tale like structurs called fegilia to move
diffusion is the movement of low concentration to high concentration in the cell membrane
osmosis is the movement of water going from a low concentration to a high concentration in the cell membrane
the cell moves its way to the cell membrane by fighting off the fungus
the substances travel through the membrane in a normal fashion
throught the pathwaysthe membrane envelopes the substance and pulls it into the cell
the cell membrane is permeable and allows substances to enter and leave the cell
one proccess used by cells is diffusion were the food is slowly allowed to pass through the membrane
another proccess is when a food particle is surrounded until it is taken into the cell
a cell is protected by a ridged cell membrane causing it to stay in place
a cell has flalgia that are finger like projections allowing it to move
a cell has cilia that are hair like projections allowing it to move
cell uses the mitchondria to produce energy for the cell
it uses the vacoule to store food and water for future times
it uses small hair like structures to move around
they move back and forth across the membrane to move
then the substance can be moved any where on the cell
first there is the cell wall in plant cells that block unwanted things from entering the cell
the mitocondria help keep dead cells off the cell membrane golgi apparatus helps keep the substances moving
three processes include mrna trna and rrna
the cell wall keeps everything inside the cell
the vacuole takes out any unhealthy stuff
the mitochondria keeps everything moving and aligned
one process used by cells to control the movement of substances is mitosis which splits the cells
another process is miosis which splits the cells again and the third process used by cells is mutation
the use of rna mrna and singnals let iff by dna
cells use the membrane to move transporter proteins in and out also marker proteins
they can be carried by another organism or could be floating around
get attached to something then it moves them
first the substances travel through the er then they go through the golgi apperatice
then the substances travel out of the cell
transportaion translation diffision transportaionthe way they get around translation the way they moved thorugh the membrain
cellular respiration which helps the movement digestive system how the organism gets food and how it reproduces
first would be that the cell membrane would squish in different direction to allow substances to cause no harm
second would be that maybe the membrane would do the exact opisite and would resist any impact
last the membrane might be to move the membrane around to make substances roll off the membrane
the next process of movement would be liquids getting under the substance and carrying it across the cell
it moves by the force of the enxymes across the cell membrane
they wiggle they have a tail and they have a something else
they use different types of systems depending on the proccess that the cell needs done
mrna to create protienslysosomes to dispose of wastegolgi to transport food
they have multiple cells stop other cells like they were border patrol
mitochondria nucleus controls where evrything is goingcytoplasm hold thing in their placemembrane moves things in out of thecell
the cell membrane lets stuff in and out
one type of movement acrossed the membrane is osmosis
osmosis is when the substance uses water to move across the membrane
active transport is the processes of moving acrossed the membrane by the membrane being selectivly permeable
diffusion is when the cells diffuse so that they can move across the selectivly permeable membrane
they get rid of nutrients they dont needthey use different cells to do certain jobs
the cell uses it organells and cell wall and membrane to controll what gos in and comes out
the ribosomes decide what enters and leaves the cell
the nucleus lets the waste exit the cell membrane
and the mitochondria decides at times what can enter
the endoplasmic reticulum helps proteins travel through the cell
transcription and translation also take place in the cell
one process is habitat locationsecond process is homeostasisthird process is geographical isolation
active transport calvin cycle and light dependent reactions
the process would be translation or transcription
information is copied and moved around in the cell by the organelles
the cell membrane the cell wall and the chloroplast
three processes that calls use to control the movement of substances are channel proteins diffusion and osmosis
passive movement alows substances to move freely through the cell membrane
the second movement requires an activation energy for substances to pass through
the third movement is when substances go through using proteins
also the use of trucking which carries the proteins throughout the endplamic reticulum
messenger uses the cell to give messages or instructions to the ribosomes from the nucleus
judges what it is that is trying to cross
only allows a certain size of something to pass through
the membrane doesnt have to let everything in
in diffusion the surface of the cell decised what substances go in and out of the cell
endo plasmic rectualum the outter wasll of a cell
osmosis the absorbtion of substances into the cellfacillitated diffusinmitosis
the cell has osmosis which means the substances move through the membrane surface not across
it also has diffusion which is how it moves things across the surface of the membrane
it also has another thing but i cant remember it
there is the cell membrane the cell wall and the membrane bound organelles
there are three known processes used by cells to control treh movement of substances across treh cell membrane
the cell wall blocksproteins will carrythe transfer of chemical make up or dna
to where the cell is allowed into the cell or not
the active transport allows only certain type of organisms to enter or leave the cell
diffusion is another way cells get in and out of the cells
one proses is called cell movement that is where the cell is moved thrue the cell by the organells
the rough er golgi membrane in the mitichondria
the three process that are used to control the movement of substances cross the cell membrane is
one is the mitocondria which controls what goes in and out of the cell
second is the vacole which is the stomach of the cell
last is the membrane which is the control center of the cell
ribosomes transport substancestrna read themrrna tells them where to go
flagella long whip like and helps the cell move the cell only has one
silla little hair like and helps the cell move many are on the cells
one decription of a way the cell controls movement is by its cell wall
the cell wall protects and sheilds the cell
another decription of a way the cell controls movement is by the nucleus
the nucleus keeps the cell functioining
lastly another way the cell controls movement is by ribosomes
pores control the movementwhen potassuim goes back and forth across cellsand when wastes are extracted from cells
actice transportpassice transportfacilitative diffusion
the cell membrane allows the material to get into the cell and materail from the cell to move out
the sugars go to the protein and forms the cells protective layer
then the cell membrane lets material go out of the cell and inside of the cell
cells process things coming in and out of the call membrane calls also
mitochondia moves stuff lysosomes move things and chlorophyll moves items
osmosisactive difffusionpassive diffusion
carrier protiens move them through the cells membrane by opening like a gate
flagella whip substances across the surface of the cell
pores open to allow small enough substances to pass through the membrane
a cell membrane is whem the cell are attack the membrane for the cell to move thought the membrane
here are three processes used by cells to control movement a dog and a cat and a human
the cell membrane is used to control the movement of substances across a cell
the cell uses the cell wall and the cell membrane to help it move substances through the cell
these help regulate what gets into the cell and what doesnt
once inside the cell the nucleus will decide what is done with those substances
another one is that the cell has cytoplasm that holds all the things together in the cell
cells can transfer substances make more or give substances
excretion is the process used by cells to remove waste products and unnecessary nutrients
one process is through absorbing the substance into the cell
one way would be that the plasma membrane controls what comes in and out of the cell
reproduction is produsing mre offsprings
the cell membrane use the receptors of the cell to send out messages of needs to be done
there are several processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane
three processes are exocytosis endocytosis and phagocytosis
the cell wall protectsthe cell from substances coming in or going out of the cell
osmosis slow spreading out equally of substances in a cell
oxygen diffusionhomestasisprotein synthesis
requires energy water can pass through plasma membrane easily
they might allow certain substances to come in but others can not
how big the openings are in the membrane
what type of cells are allowed threw the openings
crossing over mutations cellular respiration
the cytoplasm flagullum and the shape of the substances
cells can use their cell wall to control movement of substances by not letting the substances into the cell
then the trna goes out and deleviers the message to where ever it needs to go
the cell uses ribosomes to move substances across the cell membrane
kreb cycle when they move carban and oxygen around to make atp
calvin cycle when they use oxygen to make a little atp
active transport that moves the cells around to make atp
the cell uses cilla no move around to get food
the cell also ueses things golgi apperates to move things out of the cell
the cell gets rid of wastethe cell lets some substences insidethe cell makes some substances
osmosis diffusion crossing over of moving particles
well the mitchondria which pretty much is the main power source of the cell it keeps everything in check
all the cells have differnt jobs to do in the body
the cell membrane makes sure that the stuff the cell needs it makes sure it gets it
cells occuring throughout in the cell memebrane
plasmembreane to movemovement to move around the cellplacement to place something in the cell
control the brainmove where they need to becontrol the membrain
the cell membrane will only allow certain things to pass through
the cell membrane is jelly like so if it bumps into another cel there is no damage
the cell membrane doesnt allow carbon into it
the three processed diffusion of oxygen osmosis of water and faciliated diffusion
the flagellum uses its tail like structure to move around
the cillia uses its hair like substances to move around in the cell
diffusion which is a process where substances are transported across the cell membrane
the cell membrain takes nutrients from the outside of the cells and takes them to the main cell membrain
photosynthesis is the division of cells mytosis meiosis
the cell controls the movement of substances around the membrane by controling it
the cell may use asmosis to tranfer material across the cell
diffusion is whenever substances diffuse over the cells membrane
another process is the fission where the substances go through a hole in the membrane
another thing that moves cells is energy
the cell does through movements to control the cell membrane is the cell wall
it control what enters and leaves they cellflegall helps the cell move
they can use their cilia flagella or they could not move at all
cellular respiration ion channle lipid bilayer
the cell is connected to the membrane and by chanelling the membrane it tells it to move
protins also send messages to the cell to tell it to move
the cell and cells are linked and communicating all the time
they processes by cells central movement
they can move by a roddili spiralthey can process or control their movement by flagella
the cells use the cell wall to limit movement across the cellalso uses energy
the cells travel to the rna and sends a message to the mrna
osmosis diffusion and active transport
they use a barrier around them so nothing can cross
they have a flagellum that is a taillike structure that enables the cell to move
diffusion movement of cellsosmosis movment of cells using watercell division dividing of cells
they can use the golgi appuratus to move
the eukaryote carry the cells from the cell membrane
then they put up a cell wall and put chloroplast around the outside of the wall
the mitochondria chloroplast and the eukaryotic cell
the cell moves across it by diffusion respiration and movement
they use diffusion osmosis and water diffusion
blood vessels the brain vessels
the cells use the mebrane as a transportaion and they move lik a boat on water
in the crll there is a cell membrane a cell wall and protens
mitosislets things get in and outosmosiswater
the three proccesses are meoisis osmosis and diffusion
reproduction dying off of old cells and living
the nucleus controls the whole cell and its actions
the mitocondria makes proteins the cell needs to survive
the cell membrane is the gateway of the cell it controls what enters and exits the cell
the second is transcription where it controls the rate and what crosses through the cell membrane
the third is translation it helps create rna that can help later on to control what crosses the membrane
first the tranportation of materials the cell needs to survuve
seconed the transportation of waste out of the cell
and third the transportation of nutieants to the body and other cells that need it
cells use cyotplasm for certain things to move through the human body
cells also use blood to move certain proteins and cells through the body
it helps water and other materials go from cell to cell
active transport diffusion passive transport
wall cells are in plants to keep the strucure of it
one of the processes used by cells would be the the nucleous to tell the cell what to do
then there is the flagelum which is the tail the moves to help the crell move around
the last one would be the cell membrain that holdeverytjing in and not floting out
cell respiration cell movement and cellular activation
cells can multiplycells can help organscells also move throughout the cell membrane in order to keep everything funtioning correctly
the three processes used by a cell to control movement of substances across the membrane are
difusion helps move water based particels in and out of the cell
osmosis move non water based particels in ond out of the cell
the proteins only allow for specific organisms to pass through
the cell membrane is made of material which only nonpolar organisms can pass through
mitochondrian plasmids and the ribosomes
all the membranes are different from evrey other one
diffusion is one processes used by cells to cntrol movement across the cell membrane
diffusion when particles separate in the air
others just slid acrossand they work together
the cell membrane will only allow rna through
division
substances move through the organellestrna transfers it across the cell
active transport helps with the flow of water in the membrane
protein transport helps bring enzymes into the cell
the channel proteins v shaped move things in and outside of the cell
the cell uses threee processes by the names of mieosis mitosis and cell reproduction
meosis is when the cell divides and turns into another cell aloowing them to increase in numbers
mitosis is when the cell membrane forms around the nucleus to protect it
the cell membrane will open allowing and manuever nutrients into the cell
the cell membrane will manuever waste out of the cell
three processes used by cells to control movement of substances are growth synthesis and growth
three prosses that control the movement of a substance is the passive active and transport
mitosis the cells seperate and move to opposite ends of the cell membrane
making it hard for harmful substances to enter the membrane
the flagellum is used for movement across the cell membraneproteins
digestion reproduction breaking down materials
the cell membrane keeps the things from going in and out
the cell uses mitochondria on the cell membrane to move substances across
lastly the cell could use flagella to help move the substances also
the cell wall serves as a wall to keep things from getting into the cell
the cell can use the goolgi the move food and things around
the cell membrane also control what comes in and out of the cell
one way the cells controll movement of substances across the cell membrane is through it
osmosis the substances absorb into the celldiffusion they diffuse threw out the membraneactive transport helps move on thing to another
tails are used to move cells aroundthey also use tiny hairs to swim around
the next thing the cell should do is keep all organisms that they know they need to surive
diffusion the golgi and the rough endoplasmic reticulum
the processes used by cells to control movement are osmosis diffusion and active transport
for cells to move some use the flagellum
it is like a tail and moves so the cell can reach its destination
other cells also scatter around until it find the right place
there is a endoplasmic reticulum that acts like a guide in the cell
then there is flagella in the cell that helps control the movement
there is also cytoplasm that helps the control
the plasma on the out side of the membrane keeps certain things from getting in and or getting out
the move throught the blood stremthe use thir tails to move
the goglie bodies help by getting rid of stuff not needed in the cell
equialibram helps the cell gain or lose water
the endoplasmic reticulum carries things through the cell
the cell moves water in and out of the cell in the process of trranspiration
it also does this to maitian homeo stasis
selective promobility is one way that the cells control the substances
movement reproduction and respiration
movement to move reproduct to make more and respiration to help the body
transcriptiontranslationprotein synthesis
vacuoles take care of the waste products
the nuclues sends messages to the cell to tell things what to do and what is happening
the cell membrane can control what moves into and out of the cell
mitosis is when the cell divides and and that can help move things across the cell membrance
the cell need to grow and divide or else it would become to big and explode
if it didnt control what moves into and out of it we would most likely die
the cell membrane checks to see if the substance is good or bad for the cell
then the cell membrane lets the substance inside of the cell
finally the substance is transported through the cell through the endoplasmic reticulum
they might have a flagtum or whip like tail to move
the three processes are diffusion faciliated diffusion and osmosis
meioses cell division geting rid of waste
the three phases i know are metaphaseanaphase and telophase
then the golgi bodies transport whatever it is through the cell
three processes used by the cell to control movement of sudstances would be citoplasma nucius and mitocondrean
three processes are that the cell has a cell wall and is connected to other cells
another is that it chooses what to enter it and it acts like a barrier for other things
telephase gives the information to the nucleusanaphaseinterphase
they use the cytoplasm to move substances to their right place
passed to a cellgoes through somethinggets to cell membrane
osmosiscontrols the amount of water in a cell
vacolesare organelles that help control excessive water and substances being moved around the cell membrane
substances such as oxygen are controlled
the substances that move across the cell membrane are dna protiens and mrna
they could build up ane enzyme to help protect the cell
they could get rid of material that is in the way
the cytoplasm moves stuff across the membrane
protein channel moves larger substances across the cell
the use of a flagellum protist uses a flagellum to move
cross pollinationdistribution of energy the cell wall lets bad things out and traps the good things in
they have layers which regulate what can enter and exit the cell membrane
they have a screenlike function that detects weather or not a substance is sizable to enter the membrane
they have cytoplasm which holds all the organelles and substances in the membrane
they have a cell membrane which keeps organelles and substances inside the cell
the endoplasmic reticulum also moves the substances around
active transport helps get things through the membrane
osmisis one using energy one not using energy
translation takes mrna and decodes it for the cell to read and use
osmosis is another process used by cells
osmosis makes the fluid in a cell try and reach equalibrium
one type of movement control is passive transportation
eye spot flagellum and contracule vacule
there are three processes that i know of that are used by cells and they are passive and active
passive means that the substance is able to pass right through
active is when it has to go through a process to go through the cell memebrane
substances diffuse to go through the cell membrane
through regeritationthrough blood flow through urination
they move in a slow motion to ger across the member
they do not come in contact with one another
cell division cellular respiration cell wall
they let substances in and out through the membrane
all the organs in the cell have a suspecific job to do to get what the cell needs
cell membranes let go of waste eat and engulf food and can block bad stuff from getting in
they are transferedthey carry the substances
cells use different organels inside the cell to move substances across it
three processes of moving substances would be using the mitocondria to move waste from the cell
the cell wall also helps filter and move waste in and out of the cell
the cell nucleus controls what goes in and out of the cell as well
they control the movement across the cell mambrane by taking control of each individual part of the cell
meiosis is used throughout the cell membrane to control and develop more cells
mrna and rna are used as messengers to carry the information to the needed destination
lastly the information is received and it has ended
the consentration gradiant is when the partical move from higher consentration to lower consentration
active transporttransports the portiensosmosistransfers thingsdiffusiongets rid of things
the cell membrane controls what goes in and out of the cell
the nuclues is the brain of the cell and it controls what goes on inside the cell
the cell wall is barrier to sources outside of the cell and protects the cell
they use the pump function which pumps out solutes so it wont become overfilled with too much water
they use osmosis which is the movement of water against the natural flow
they have transport proteins which allow things to come through the cell
trnasends a message to the nucleus translation gets waste material out
rnacytoplasmcell membrane they all go through the process of movement of substances in a cell
interphase which is the longest phase in the cell
the three are slime filagine and micro organisums
trna transports proteins to the nucleusmrna carries genetic information
dna meosis rna and protein synthesis
they use the flagellum to move therefore it could help move things across the membrane
endocytosis is used to let large mollecules into cells
exocytosis is used to get them out of the cells
three processes used to control cell movement are
a second way you could transfer substances is by transfering enzymes through the cell membrane
a third way substances get transfered through the cell membrane is using mrna to transfer proteins through the cell
cell wallblocks unwanted material from getting incytoplasmhelps regulate rna
the three processes used by cells to control movement of substances are mitosis meiosis and passive
passive is when substances can get through easily
meiosis is also the process how cells divide as mitosis is too
flaglummoves cellcillia help cell stick to surfaces
some of the cells use their ribosomes to manuverthem
then they could also use their endoplasmic reticulum or their er to make this process possible
this is only a few posible ways that cells could control the movement of substances across the cell membrane
convergent evolution divergent evolution
the movement of the body your bones to help you excersiseblood type
the cell membrane uses diffusion and osmosis
the three things used by cells are cellular resperation
free pass or moving freely through the membrane
diffusion or the movement of water from high pressure area to low pressure are through the membreane
proteins or the movement of proteins through special small tubes in a cells membrane
they control the movement by telling things where to go
the cell membrane has processes that it has
the genetic information start out as combinations in the nucleus
the third process is trna or transfer rna which transfers the message to the specific orgnelle
selctionthe membrane choosess what substancess can come inside the cell i dont knowi dont know
gel in the cells can help transport substances around the cell membrane
they have the whip like structurecells to control the movement and to gather the food
gather up and move as a team to protect each other
cell membrane allows certain materials to move around the cells
osmosis active transport and passive transport
the three substances that control the movement across the call membranethe call wallclorplastmitochondrion
osmosisactive transportpassive transport
there are different kinds of processes that cells use in this case in humans such as
the red blood cells controll the blood coming from the heart to throughout the body
it also detects what is suppose to get into the cell
the cell membrane blocks cells from moving around
a process called cellular respiration
osmosis diffusion endocytosis controls what comes into the cell
active transport passive transport and protein channels
the cytoplasm helps to hold all of the organells and helps things to move
the nucleus controls everythingthe mitochondria tells wat enters and leaves the cell
the way the cell membrane is designedit lets so much water in it
acctive transport diffusion nonactive transport
most cells have a cell wall to controll what goes in and out of the cell membrane
red blood cells carry oxygen around the blood stream
proteins control movementnucleus controls the cellsdna makes proteins
photosynthesis cellular respiration and the phosphorus cycle
cells conrol movement by useing flagellen and enzymes to encounter the product of movement
resperation is one way it takes substances across the cell
food gathering also is another way when it gathers the food
cell selection is another way they select what they want
the cell nucleus controls what goes in to the cell and comes out of it
it controls the blood going through your veinsit filters the waist productsit helps the blood count
cell membrane controls what enters and leaves the cell
its like a security guard in the white house
the nucleus reads the information and decides if it should leave or enter the cell
the cell wall protects what enters and leaves the cell also
the three processes used by cells are they
the cell membrane is the reproducion because this cell es movemen
a third process is the creation of cells this is a big part of cell movement
you cant just have one cell and expect it to do everything like move create energyetc
the three processes include trna mrna and rrna
the cell membrane is controlloed by the nucleous and it goes through processes called meioses reproduction
rna vacoules proteinsthey each move things across the cell
the cell has has a cell membrane top control the movement
a cell also contains proteins which determine what does and does not enter the cell
they block things from getting in and leaving
endoabsorbing allows substances to enter a cell through the layer of proteins in the cell membranes
interphasetelopahsemetaophaseanaphase
first the protien comes up to the opening to pass through
cells is what your body has in it so you can live
cells cary anything to where ever it goes
there are many ways a cell controls the movement if substances across the cell membrane
a third thing is when a pump is told by the nueclus to work
enzynes break down protein builds up and everything is sent to the nucleous
cells will either allow or reject substances into the cell through its cell membrane
once a substance is inside of the cell it moves through the cell
when it leaves the cell it leaves through respiration
the cell moves the to another placethe membrane controls where the cells go
they use diffusion to bring things in and out of the body
they use fission to move things around in the body
there are thre different movements for substances in a cell
but bringing more substance in for a cell uses little to no energy at all for a cell
the three processes are prophase metaphase and anaphase
the cells use the mitochondria to move things across the cell membrane
they also use thier golgi bodies and endoplasmic reticulum
one way is when cells go and they start to divid and split a part to make new cells
sugar cells tubicles and charbohydrates
itmblocks substances from entering or leaving the cell membrane
the cell necluous sends information to the other cells to move the whole organism
the first process used by cells to control the movement of substances acrossed the cell membrane are ion channels
they let only ions pass through the lipid bilayer and move along the cell
the second process that is used are carrier proteins they help carry the proteins acrossed the cell
they help move the substances across the cell so they can pass through the cell membrane
cell wall it helps keep the substance in the membrane
the cell may send signals to the membrane and it will go
the cell may also have helped by giving it dna
the cell may have communicated with other cells in the organism
nucleus is the boss tells the cell what to do
one is the ribosomestwo is the microtidsthree is the microtons
interphase is the biging of the cell cycle where the chromatids duplicate
anaphase the second is the stage where the nucleus dissapears
prophase is where the sister chromatids line up in the middle of the cell
one process is through the use of cyclins
they use passive transport active transport and possecive transport
a cell uses diffusion osmosis and active transport to move substances across th e cell wall
cells have a cell wall which controls what goes in and out of the cell
diffusion liquid slowly spreads solid through liquid until its spread out evenly ex
the membran when it go to the nuclus when the cell needs rna
cells have many different substances that need moving across the membrane
one process would be electron transport chain etc
the electron transport chain or etc carries neutrons across the cell membrane
another process would be active transport
active transport is used in prokayreotes and eukaryotes
it carries waste out and carries proteins in
one last thing that cells use is diffusion
diffusion carries everything the cells need across the cell membrane and balances the waste products
diffusionactive transportpassive transport
cell wall nucleus and the cell membrane help control the movement of substances across the cell membrane
protein gets to the cell it helps the muscles move
the cell is like a fillter on both sides
cells have a flagella that helps them move
its really cramped in there because every thing is so close
then they are molded into place and they stay there untill there job is complete
protien synthesis goes through the membrane after the ribosomes produce them
seperate they grow apartreproduce the multiply conjoin the from together
protein syntheis evolution and evolving
also the lysosome in a cell removes unwanted or dead proteins from a cell
the cell membrane is a third regulatory structure of the cell used much like the cell wall
they use cytoplasm to move stuff through cells
they ahve holes in the cell membrane or cell wall to regulate what goes in and out
they use the flagella they divide and multipy
active transport passive transport osmosis
translation transcription and protein synthesis
the flagella is a tail like attachment of a cell that allows the cell to move around
the cell wall protects the cell and allows only specific particles in and out of it
the cytoplasm is picky and only allows certain materials to pass through it as well
the cells have to divide so they dont get to big
meiosismitosis the cell divides into twoviscosity where water flows on the substance
the cell membrane tries to equal up the movement of substances from side to side
first the subtances flow freely through the membrane
then when the cell has gotten enough substances the membrane sends substances out of the cell
cells use the cell membrain to move and some cells use there flugelam to sem and use it to swim
transporting reproducing and protecting
they have to transport food all around the cell and different functions
the cells have to reproduce to make more cells to live
the cell wall protects the inside of the cell so nothing gets out
cell wallprotects by keeping the bad stuff out
they use the cell wall to keep bad things out and good things in
cilla which also helps the cell move slime on the cell wall helps the cell move
the cells verifies the substances first
second it opnes the wall to the accepted substance
once the substance is through it closes the whole and waits for another substance to come by
lastly it fights against bad things that enter the cells
another use would be to recieve proteins or other necessities
finally it can be used to keep out harmful substances
protien genes and gemetesthe protein gos into the cellthe genes growsand the gemetes develope
the cell membrane has holes in it for proteins and enzymes to pass through
it also has a gate to keep unwanted molecules out
certain molecules must become attached to the passage for the molecule to pass through
three process used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are
it helps block any unwanted subsances from passing into the cell if they got passed the cell wall
if it is supposed to leave it will let it pass through
osmosisselectively permeable and diffussion
the three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances are the cellular tissue
this controls what goes in and out of the cell
then lysosomes that control what waste leaves the cell
followed by ribosomes that make proteins
osmosis is the dirusion of a substance through a selectively permeable membrane usually a substance such as water
difusion is the difusion of other semismall chemicals or atoms moving across the membrane
phospholipid difusion is the difusion of larger chemicals or atoms across a membrane with the use of a protien
the cell membrane selects what can and can not cross into the cell
theres passive somethings and active somethings in the cell membrane
there are cells to transport protiens
there are cells to let different substances in and out of the membrane
the cells will control movement by the cell wall the cell membrane and the flagelluim
the cell process controls what enters and leaves tthe cell membrane
it helps control the movement and helpoi t function better
well the cell have to move though the membrane to the chain of reaction
chromosomes for a male and chromosomes for a female
mitosis and meiosis take place in the function of a cell
cells use the organelles to help move things
they often have many different ways to move things
they also use the smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum
a chain is the process used by cells to move something across the cell
the chain passes it from one to another and so on
another way is when the phosphates that have two tails and a head keep things out of the cell
osmosis controls amount of water in the cell
the size of the substance trying to move through the organism
transportation is where the cell transports proteins and sugars
transcription is where the cell rads what kind of protein or sugar its dealing with
transformation is when they transform into bigger cells
active transport it is used by the cell membrane to transfer items throughout the cells
the cell membrane decides if the items can pass through the cell or not
it can split up ribosomes or keep fluids from entering the cell
the cell membrane is the main protector of the cell
the cells can be carried through th blood stream
the cell membrane regulates what goes in and out of the cell
osmosistransports wateractive transport transports proteinsdiffusion
the first process is when the ribosomes collect all of the substances to take it in the cell
the other process is when the ribosomes takes the substances out
the third is when a virus injects its protein in the cell
the cell membrane controls what enters and exits the cell
the rna and proteins help control the movement of substances across the cell membrane
nucleus allowing substances to enter through the membranecell membrane allowing substances throughproteins leaving the membrane
three types of processes used by cells to control the movement of substances are osmosis
organisms enter the cell membrane helps it with the cell and leaves the cell membrane
diffusionwater molecules move across the membranecell membranecontrols substances that pass through itnucleusdecides which substances can go through the membrane
then the package is dumped inside the cell
cell difusion cell reproduction cell osmosis
goes with othere movementit uses a tailhas a way
the cells use the cell wall and the nucleus
the flagellum psudapod and the phylopod
the three processes are diffusion osmosis and polymerization
the cell wall helps keep track of what enters and leaves the cell
enzyme protis ad they have to take in a eukaryote
osmosis passive intake physical intake
some cells just going right throught it
but not all the cells can go through it
plus they have to go through the cell wall
reprodution cytokenisiscelluar respitory
the cell membrane uses energy to let certain things in and keep certain things out
the cell wall helps keep things out of the cell
endocytosis process by which materials move into the cellexocytosisprocess by which matrials move out of the cellsolute pumping
one of the three processes is deleation deleation is where it takes one of the cells away
the second of the three is replication that is where one of the cells are replicated
the cytoms go to the opposite ends of the cell membrain
the second form of process is metaphase
it puts all of the chromosomes in the middle and lines them up
cells control the movement by carrying the information to other parts of the cell
protine pump membrane pores phosphate pump
one process is fussion to get through the cell mebrane
they have got flagella to help them move around the cell
the mitochondiria produce and shoot out energy for the cellthe lipids carry things acrosscytoplasm allows things to manuver across
one process is organellesanother process is transportationthe last process is checkpoints
one process by which cells move substances across the membrane is the movement of rna
three processes used by cells include the cell membrane cell wall and cholorplasts
the cells use the endoplasmic reticulum to move protiens
the cells use the flagella to move the cell itself
these cells move themselves through the membrane either through or around it
three processes are trna mrna and rrna and those trafer thing throught the membrane of the cell to synthesize proteins
osmosis water trasnsferprotein channels tubbules that channel protiens through the membranecell membrane limints what come in and outof the cell
one way to control the movement of substances arcoss the membrane is the stomata
this controls how much materials go into and out of the cell by opening and closing
another way to control the movement is by diffusion
some water goes into the cell while other go away
cellular respiration also helps the movment of substances
difusion is the movement of water through a permeable membrane
it closes the membranes that transfer sugars and other liquidsit shrinksit swells
the cell membrane controls wats goes in and out the cell
so the cell membran knows how to prevent future problems so the cell will stay stable
the cell uses the movement of the liquid to move
the processes used by cells to control the movement of substance across the cell membrane by meiosis
they let the cell move or the cell would have a flagella
they also use the mrna and rna as messengers
tansports the protein to the mitoconderen
they control the flow of the substances
movement so they can get place to place
recepter rotience only let serian thing through channel protience let things through ther cell wall
smaller things can alos go through the wall
the plasma membrain aids in how the cell moves
also the plasma membrain also controlls how cells take in food and how the excrete waist
the plasma membrain also helps keep the cell its shape
cilia moves cellcytoplasmkeeps the organelles in cellflagellummoves cell
diffusion is used by cells to allow substances to enter the cell
cells use organelles to move things around it
there are of things that can be used to move it throughout the cell
they are the smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulims
one process would be mitosis and another would be meiosis
a diffrent process would be respiration
the three types of movements are diversion equilibrium and distrubition
diversion is the process of one substance passing through the membrane
equilibrium is the process of balancing the concentration on both sides of the membrane
distribution is the process of moving two different substances to opposite sides of the membrane
they control what the cell does and where it goes
chemical reactionmitosis reproduction of cellmiosis
the cell can use transport proteins which are always open to any and all sbstances that fit
the cell membrane sends the a message to another part of the cell membrane
then it sends the substances threw tubes
the three processes would be reproductionrespirationand food gathering
diffusion exocysitosis and endocitosis
exocysotosis moves things out of the cell and endocytosis moves things into the cell
diffusion moves water into and out of the membrane
glycolosis krebs cycleelectron transport chain
the smooth ertransfors stuff to the nucles
the rough ertakes stuff from yhe nucles
cells use their cell walls to stop harmful substances
they also use their flagellum to control the movement across the cell membrane
three processes used by cells to move substances across the cell mambrane are active transportdifussion
the cell aslo has molecules that protect itself from bad things
there are three types of ways that cells move substances across the concentration gradient
the cell membrane only allows certain materials intop the cell by guarding the wall
they move in litle gorps and eat batrea and can reporduce asexually
the cell membrane is a jelly like substance
the cell membrane keeps in nutrients and things that are vital for the cell to live
a cell uses the plasma to hold all of the organelles in place
the cell wall processes the movement in and out of the cell
different parts of the cell control the movement of substances across the cell membrane
the nucleus carries out genetic information such as dna to the rest of the cell
the mitochondrian transport energy throughout the cell
the cytoplasm allows this movement to take place throughout the cell as well
cells are the basic unit of all living things
cells have numerous functions such as fighting off infections when they enter out body
they also transport information all over our body
they let the rest of our bodies know what theyre suppose to do
cells also keep us living and breathing
cells push out unwanted or unnecessary materials from the bodycells created other cells
the cell membrain only let certain stuff in to the nucleus
send signals to nerves move itself places make whole groups of cells
cell divitioncell reproductioncell movement
there are certain cell organelles that controll what goes in and out of the cell
also substances are moved in and out of the cell by diffusion
another way is cells are able to controll how much of sometimes goes in or out of the cell
cells are the primary block in life and are responsible for for the many complex things that we do
cells make tissue that make organs that make organ systems
they use flagelates pseudopods or cilia
cells have a cell membrane that controls the movement of substances that come in and out of the cell
also the surface area plays a roll in controlling the movement of substances aswell
it is the same as if the volume is larger than the surface area
there is a process called osmosis to move substances in and out of cells
cells also have proteins that move substances around the membrane
lastly cells use channel proteins which channel energy
the lipeds let the suff in that is needed for thecell
they move the cellsthey keep them were the need to be
one process the cell uses to move substances across the membrane is through the nucleus
this example is a more specific way that shows how cells control movement within the membrane
the cell membrane desides what can go into the cell and what cant
the nucleus tells where each individual needs to go
transcription translation and transversion
the cellular membrane stops unwanted materials from getting into the cell
the nucleus decides what it wants inside of the cellthe cytoplasm slows untwanted materials so they can be killed
flagella is a long tail cilia little hair like things
difutionactive transportelectron transport
cells also use the mitochondria to move substances
one way the cell controls the movement across the membrane is by knowing where to go
sunwater and soilit makes the plant stay alive so it controls what the plant does
then they use metaphase to come togteher
then lastly use telophase to seperate into cells
mrna protein synthesis photosynthesis
cell wall allows certain things to enter and exit the cellthe light and dark reactionsphotosynthesis
they use translation transcription and replication
flagella are used for movement by the cell
cellular respiration is a processed used by the cell to breathe
mitosis is another process used by the cell to reproduce
kill the white cellsclean throughout your bodyrum blood through you whole body
first they have to be a substance that the cell requires
then it passes through the membrane through a certain canel

rose conversations were based on there trait there are all from cambodia
one trait that can describe rose is that she is stressed
the time rose was talking to anna about why thier dad had to leave because of a job
the job in la paid better then what he was making here
rose is sweat and wouldnt want to hurt anyone like anna
it was when anna and rose were talking in the kitchen
one trait that rose has is that she is understanding
rose is trying to make anna understand that her family is just trying to help them out
only if you have everything rose said
she tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her
we have our part to do to help paul finish college
i think shes just feelin alot of pressure with all that shes doing
so the trait i think she has is patience
shes always waiting onand helping others
shes always helping others and i think that means she has patience
if i had to show one trait from rose it would be based the conversation with anna
traits i can see from this conversation is she is in a way nieve
one trait i can describe rose as having is she thinks that she does everything for the family
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
rose feels tied down by what she is doing to help her family
roses sister gets upset when they start talking about their father being gone
the first trait that rose exemplifies is the trait of expressing someones feelings
rose seems shes got an anger issueshe stood up and stalked out of the kitchen
her younger sister walked in rubing her eyes and rose said what is wrong
rose is scared of hurting her aunt by telling the truth
she is stressed she is constantly thinking and feeling overwhelmed
one trait that is used by rose in the story is her support
rose laugh was gone sound fake and paul finshing college
in the last paragraph it says that rose kept nodding
this is meaning that rose opens up to all options she has that her aunt kolab gives to her
one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with anna is that she is sincere
rose listens to anna as she tells rose she is sad for her two parents
rose tries and cheers her up and looks on the positive side of things
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
and probably her aunt would tell her mother
she goes to work and then comes home and helps her aunt prepare a quick supper
she stood and stalked out of the kitchen
she was angry but very miss understanded
rose can be described as being reserved about her true feelings
rose is not a person that gives up even when it gets rough
she thinks about the getting the job done
when aunt kolab was talking to her she was thinking that she could use that topic for her essay
rose is really worried about what will happen in her future
shes afraid of hurting people emotionally
in the passages in says rose didnt anser
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
in the story rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream so it would loosen her grip
she told anna how she felt when they were talking
one trait that descirbes rose is strong
he had to leave because he needed to raise money for the family
rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream
if she told her the truth she would hurt aunt
one trait would be the ability to think deeply
she comes up with the idea to make special treats
she is respectful because she didnt want to hurt her aunt
indicating that she had felt pressure attempting to help the family
rose dosnt necesarily like the fact on her aunt telling her up
that they were fighting about something and then they didnt want that conversation to go any further
rose is not very expressive of how she truly feels
aunt kolab asked her if she felt weighed down by helping the family
one trait is her way to deel with pain or emotions
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
shes sort of selfish it seems like all she is focused on is herself
anna values family over material things in the world
she is sincere she tries to comfort her sister when she talks about missing her father
rose tells anna that her father went to work because he already had everything else he needed except money
rose says that they have their part to do while paul is away at college
this shows that rose is independent and smart
in roses conversation with aun kolab rose reveals her concern for other peoples feelings
her care of others feelings show up previously in her conversation with anna
she was being sarcastic with her sister
she doesnt want so much responsibility weighing down on her
one word that can describe rose is busy
if she won that competition she would not be able to go to sacramento
her dad is also in los angeles andher brother paul is at college
she is very frustatid because she has not got her essay complet
the one trait that can describe rose is intelligent
one example of this is that she is going to enter an essay contest
rose is concerned and is filled with self conflict
didnt know wether or not to tell her aunt
rose is a very positive person and is the oldest of her sister anna
rose is a good person and wants to do everything she can for the family
by the time rose tiptoed into their room anna was already snoring lightly
rose slid into bed and watched the lights from passing cars move across the walls
they became the light that had illuminated the stage att pauls high school graduation
that she has to much thigns to do and its all in her hands
her mother works very long nights nad her dad work all over the world
rose and her aunt kolab can trust each other and not argue about it
that roses topic was suddenly lighter after the talk with her aunt kolab
after having the conversatino with her aunt kolab rose finally realized that her life could be getting easier
in the story it said that she was trying to squeeze her essay into her busy day
although she was under enormous selfenflicted pressure she still manged to emerge with an essay topic
if she does speak she used short and choppy sentences
she is having a hard time with everything becouse of the essey and the family
rose is very honest about her situation
her aunt can see this from their conversation
rose internalizes all her pressure and misgivings
she hides her true feelings when she talks to anna
she tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her
even thou she is just a child she thinks as an adult
she explains to anna that they have a part in this family to help paul finish college
most kids would complain about the work but instead she works with no complaint
in the conversation with anna rose seemed to have been worried about her essay
rose is a busy person with too much on her plate
only if you already have everything rose said
rose seems exhausted as if shes mad that she had to grow up so soon
she doesnt like the fact that she has to have so much responsibility
her papa not being there is what makes it worse for her
even thought she thought it was better off for him to be in los angeles
in her conversation with aunt kolab the only time she actually speaks is to relay her dream
rose doesnt like the fact that her brother has taken responsibility for both rose and her sister
in her conversation with anna she says we have our part to do to help paul finish college
imaginative because she thought of that dream
rose fell asleep trying to work on her essay
when anna walked in rose asked if she was ok and anna said no
this goes to show that she is always busy and has little time to do anything else
rose didnt want to answer because she was prepared to take care of the family
you can tell this because she barely has time to right an essay because of her job
rose seems to have the trait of being stressed
part of that conversation reflets the effort rose is putting into everything and how stressed she truely is
she wants to get into college and she thinks money will do the trick
they both believe money will support their lives
this shows that rose cares more about money than then her family making her selfish
rose is honest when she tells aunt kolab about her dream
rose thinks that money is very important and determines your overall state of wealth and her sister doesnt
and to me this is just like saying that rose wouldnt be happy unless she had everything
a detail about her is that she is a very strong girl
one detail i can identify from this story is that their family most likely came from a different country
or i could make special treats from our country and sell them
rose is reminding person because she reminds her sister about how they have to help their brother
an example of this then rosa says we have our part to do to help paul finish college
instead of complaining about whats wrong she keeps it to herself and talks about whats right
one trait of rose is that she is obediant
one thing that describes rose is that she is over worked and tired
one detail is that most of her days had been too long too demanding
she also refers to a laugh that came no where near soundind sincere
i think that rose is a giving person because she says maybe i can sew for ladies
or could make special treats from our country and sell them
she wants to help because she loves her family though she is struggling
ignorant because she didnt give up on all here work to do
her life can get easier maybe it wouldnt so it might ot might not
rose seems to go along with what other people have to say
she doesnt seem like one to get angry with people very easily
anna misses him too and she says she doesnt care about the money
in the story your perspective is from rose
rose like other humans has many traits to her personality
an example of this is how she works to help her brother get through college
she seems to be constantly busy but doesnt outrightly complain about it
this is an example of a trait i find rose has
to me rose seems like a competitive girl
meaning by that the fact stating she has to write a three thousand word essay
i think rose is decribed as a hard worker an is exhausted
this example supports my answer why i think rose is decribed as a hardworker an is exhausted
strong in paragragh tweenty three she realized that her family could survive an ocean crossing
one trait that rose is dealing with is poverty
rose feels she does not do enough to help
roses father moved elsewhere to get more money for the family
paul is going to college trying to make it through
poverty is sad to say is what trait rose was stricten with
standing up and and helping there brother paul get off to a good collage
they do think a like she think different but they both miss papa
you can see this because rose does not want tell her family how she really feels
rose kept nodding when she was talking with her aunt kolad or she pretend everything was going to fine
she has many conflicts going on with her family along with school stressors
the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here
but on the other hand she can hurt people and can be annoying
this is the trait i chose that best fits rose
rose is very weighed down by all of the stresses in her life
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
and probably her aunt would tell her mother
anna dont really tell how she realy feels
in her conversation with aunt kalob she dont tell her how she really feels about helping the family
one trait is exhausted she feels this way because she feels it is all up to her
her conversation with aunt rose verifies this
one trait that can describe rose based on her conversation with anna is that she is lonely
she shows that she really wants them in her life and is heartbroken that they are not
she helps a lot around the house even though she does not like to do it
but she finds herself in a self centered position and would complain about how terrible her life is
cambodian tradition and sense of family she realized could survive an ocean crossing
in paragraph thirteen rose is even troubled in her sleep about her overwhelming problems during the day
this suggest that her life has become busy to the point of an overwhelming capacity
in this story rose bears a lot of responsibility
rose feels too much pressure and she tries unsuccessfully to convince herself that she is alright with everything
in the story rose is hesatent to tell her feelings because she doesnt want to hurt anyone
she saysif she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
rose seems a bit overloaded according to her conversation with aunt kolab
rose can be decribed as patient during her conversation with anna
instead she remains tolerant which takes a great deal of patience on her part
she seems somewhat self centered for example when her sister walks in the room she asks whats wrong
roses conversation with aunt kolab suggests that rose is very mature and responsible for her age
roses aunt can see how much stress she is under
rose doesnt say anything though knowing the family needs money to survive
there mad that their mom has to work so late
mamas not home yet is he i hate how late she has to work
when roses sister walked and asked whats worng
rose tried to tell than she was fine that just she had another bad dream
anna wants to mean that rose start to think and talk like her mother
rosa is a very buisy person and does not have enough time for herself or her homework
the conversations with anna or aunt kolab was a good sisters relationship
one trait that describes rose based on her conversations with anna is pessimistic
she doesnt believe that their life will get better as fast as anna would like it to
she doesnt like to see people disappointed or u happy
for example if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
rose is a selfabsorbed american teenager
she feels sorry for herself and believes she has a great burdon on her shoulders
she does not realize that all of her family has had to work hard
her aunt realize that she is like this because of where she was raised
i think that rose seems lonely and that is why she has so much in her life
i think that she feels the same way anna does but doesnt want to admit it
rose was very busy on a normal day to day basis
rose has reoccurring dreams about things of her brother
rose jus responded with a simple answer of its only been four months
that rose didnt answer if she told the truth or not
to try to confort her the people that she see in dis stress
it is easily surmisable from the text that rose can be described as burdened
rose and anna both have a hard time writting an essay
when they get mad they dont want to do it anymore and they walk off
this is shown when she keeps having bad dream
she was more concerned about the essay then roses bad dream or how she was feeling
she works all the time to help her family and has no time for herself
rose feels overworked and wants an easier life
this based on when aunt kolab asked her if its difficult for her to imagine life in cambodia
rose is under a lot of pressureparagraph says she has to write a flawless threethousand word essay
rose is a very afraid to let any one down
this trait is both good and bad for her personality
it is a good thing because she is always there when someone needs something
she would do anything to help someone around her
rose is very well at thinking before she speaks
in paragraph she thaught about what to say because she did not want to hurt her aunt
the reason i say this is because in paragraph nineteen it says rose didnt answer
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
and probabaly her aunt would tell her mother
he has been gone for four months which seems like he had been gone for years
rose is not a person who will easily express her feelings
she is worried that her older brother is going to weigh her down
the dream in which paul sinks like a rock on top her supports my answer
they are both kinda upset that their dad had to go to los angelous for his work
they both knew that he was making more money that ever
also by listening to her aunt kolab she is starting to think her life might get easier
i think the reason is her aunt kolab seems to help people see the good in life
one trait that can describe roses trait would be while shes listening to aunt kolab
she is a busy body cause she always has stuff to do
busywhen would she have time to squeeze writing into her schedule
she grew up here and here mom and everybody else grew up in cambodia
rose was nice to her sister at first but then kinda got angry
in the story they were talking about their dad and rose made anna mad
this shows that she is very unpleased and that she is very tired and irritable
rose tells anna and aunt kolab that she is in some way being weighed down
rose had a dream that paul was holding her down
rose is the kind of person that is very straight forward bout things
in the passage she tells her sister things that she may not wan na hear
rose is dismissive and a little passive
she answers her aunt truthfully but only with nonverbal communication
this shows shes dissmissve for the subject
one trait that can describe rose is that she never get angry at the people she loves
rose feels wieghed down by everything and trying to help out the family all the time
when her aunt asks her if she feels weighed down she does not answer
rose feels like she is being weighed down and cant help her family
rose is unhappy and supresses her feelings of how she really feels to make others feel better
she doesnt want others to see her as someone who can only take so much
she also jokes about money with anna as if things were alright with money at this time
this just tells you that her and her aunt would talk about it openly
they are in the same family and like roses
rose had a talk with her aunt and it made her ffeel alot better then she actually felt
she says that she works a shift at a job somewhere
rose talks to her sister anna and they start getting in a argument about there family and money
she is also brave for talking to her aunt about what is going on
i could tell that she was up set with the way that things were happening to her
her aunt sees that and offers to make some stuff to sell that comes from her country
in roses conversation with anns she seems very passive and not engaged in the situation
when she explains to ana that he had to go
rose does not really intend to comfort her sister in their conversation
she thinks its all about moneyanna glared at rose
only if you already have verything rose said
one trait that can describe rose is hardworking
her aunt then askes her is she feels weighed down by what she is doing to help the family
it seems like hes been gone for years
this tells me that rose is a family girl
she is not happy unless her family is with her and supporting her
she is not happy about her dad having to leave for a job in los angeles
rose thinks that there is something wrong with anna
i think shes affraid to tell people whats wrong with her
one trait of rose seen in her conversation with anna is a selfish trait
anna is attempting to confide in rose but rose just pulls the conversations topic back to herself
a supporting fact is when she was talking to anna after she had a bad dream
she tried to laugh but it sounded fake even to her
rose tries to hide how she really feels
when she talks to anna she tries to sound reassuring even though she is worried
for example she tries a laugh that sounded fake even to her
she acts like her mom and says the same things
her sister told her she sounded just like their mom
she doesnt mind working hard for the family even though it might hurt her
a trait that rose can be described by is realistic
she knows that the money will go to good use by putting his children through college
in the story rose feels depressed as if she has no way out
this gives her the trait that she is confused about her family
shes needs to be more open with her aunt instead of being scared
this is because after anna says money isnt everything
rose says only if you have everything
that she puts stuff off till the last minute
my proof of this is i fell asleep working on my essay
she does not want to write her three thousand word paper
she has two conversations with people but yet she doesnt work on her paper
her aunt talk about how life going to change
she is very smart and knows what she is talking about
rose is wanting someone to take care of her
example is that when her brother gets out of college she said he will take care of us
rose asked her younger sister if she was ok and asked why she was up so early
her sister said because i had a bad dream
its weighting her down and stressing her out
one trait that can describes rose in her talk with aunt kolab would be attentive
rose was attentive when she kept listening and nodding to what her aunt kolab was telling her
she wants to be selfish but know she cant so she does small selfish acts like ignoring anna
i fell asleep working on my essay rose said
rose is kinda like the mother figure in this story
she has alot of responsibilies to take care of
in paragraph line she says she felt too young for so much responsibilty
rose has a trait that makes her look like she is not confident in herself
its only been four months rose said as gentily as she could
the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here
there are lots of things that rose has to be doing
she thought maybe her life would get easier
when anna told rose money isnt everything
rosess response was only if you already have everything
one trait that she has is that she isnt someone that is going to give up easly
one trait that can describe rose based on her conversation with anna is that she believes money is everything
anna said money isnt everything and rose said only if you already have everything
that she dont like to talk to people about how she feels
in her conversation with anna she does not seem to care that her dad is gone
all she seems to care about is the money
cambodian tradition and sense or family she realizedcould survive an ocean crossing
aunt kolab asks if rose is weighed down because of the family but she doesnt respond
rose is clearly open and feels her aunt is trustworthy
when she has that bad dream she goes straight to her to let it off her chest
she has a good relationship with her aunt in which case she could express her feelings to help herself
rose feels helpless in her situation to help pay for her brothers college
this is shown in her dream when she is drowning from the weight of her brother
when doesnt want to ever talk about what is truly wrong
when asked if she feels weighed down by what she is doing for the family she answers yes
that she feels forced into what shes doing and wants a easier wayand time for herself
the day like most of her days had been too long too demanding
example when would she squeeze in writing a flawless threethousand word essay
rose seems to have many traits in this story
but the one that sticks out the most to me is being independent
rose has a lot of different obstacles but she seems to be alone
even though she is not forced she feels it has to be done and without her everything will fail
an example from the story would be anna rose said
rose is surrounded by lots of things and is having to grow up fast
she does not have that much time on her hands ever
this is true because his jod includes him to never be home
in the future they hope he has enough money to send them to collage
we have our part to do to help paul finish college
this shows that she is an incourager and also how she is an adult to
do you feel so wighed down by what youre doing to help this family
she has a temper when talking with anna
when aunt kolab says maybe we can find a way to do things differently
she just wants to make others happy and try to keep the peace beteen people
she is a smart young girl that knows what she wants in life
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
when rose was talking to her aunt kolab she just kepted nodding she didnt say much
that makes me think that she is emberassed
when she kept nodding her head thinking that her life would get easier
that tell us that she care about her family
cause she work just to get her brother throw college
she also says that even if she did write the essay she dont tihnk that she would win
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
that rose dont only think about herself she also thinks about others
she doesnt think she can be helped very easily
trough the conversation with anna gives rose a comforting older sister personality
it seems like hes been gone for years
she reveals her dream to aunt kolab to find out what her dream could have possibly meant
she feels like she has a ton of weight on her shoulders
she also has to take care of her little sister in the meantime
she feels like she must be completly responsible it has caused her to over work herself
she seem like she like to keep to herself alot doesnt really care to talk much to people
worrisomshe worries about how pauls fate lies in her hands partially
she is understanding about the whole situation with her dad because she isnt upset that he left
based on the story i read patience is a trait that can be used to describe rose
although she has a heavy load on her shoulders she does not take her stress out on others
when her sister came into her room she calmly asked her if she was okay
that shes very busy and always doin something
her mom works late and she misses her dad for being gone for months for work
she just feels exhuasted and cant do anything
she was a very busy person and if she won she could not go to sacramento
she says her aunt might tell her mom and if she does shell hurt her
well one trait that i cans ee is that she believes that she always takes things the negative way
rose believes that everything will be better because of her dad working in los angeles
rose seems like she respects her elders and listens to what the have to say
in the story rose listend to what aunt kolab interperetted about her dream
rose is the type of person that knows her purpose and that her actions are for a reason
rose shows that she has faith in paul and faith that working hard will pay off in the end
she tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her
rose is a shy person when it comes to describing her feelings to others
one trait that can describe rose based on her conversation with aunt kolab is that she is nice
one detail from the story that supports my answer is she didnt answer aunt kolab question
she is hesatant to feel like things will be better
she always has to work and never gets any time to herself
but her aunt is trying to make it better rose gives suggestions as hmm
maybe we can find a way to do things differently
they have already done everything they can
roses conversations between anna and her herself show how independent she is
when talking to her younger sister she acts like her mother and watches over anna
she tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her
anna rolled her eyes and shoved her chair away from the table
rose is a lonely person rose had glanced at her parents faces
that anna is her little sister and that they hate when they mother is always working late
one of roses traits in the story is being insercure about herself
one trait that identifies rose is that she likes to make other people happy
rose realized she was a stronge person and could get through anything
rose is the type of person that is curious someone that gets to the bottom of things
as stated from the text four eyes shining with tears
rose akways looks on the bright side of thingsshe knows she can do anything
rose is somewhat selfish compared to the rest of her family
they had had to brave coming to america from cambodia
rose had no idea what cambodia was like and how bad it was there
she seems uncaring and ignores what her sister anna or how she is feeling
exhausted i feel asleep working on my essay rose said
she tries to find a away to suppres her feelings
when anna came in to the kitchen at the start of the story rose asked whats wrong
anna said im fine i just had another bad dream
she gets up and goes pour her sister a class of orange juice
one trrait that rose has is shes selfcentered
when rose was talking to her aunt kolab
i think that rose is just being selfish and just doesnt want to help out with anything
shes basically only thinking about herself
maybe i can sew for the ladies or make special treats and sell them
i think that she is faithful becuase in both conversations she wants to do something to help
in the conversation with anna she wants life to be easier so that they can go to college
things like sewing some things for women from there or make special treats
she is very devoted to her school work she wont give up
i think rose felt frustrated or weighed down on by her family
aunt kolab mentioned to rose that her parents and aunt kolab went through similar situations in cambodia
do you feel so wighed down by what youre doing to help this family
rose feels too much pressure on herself
she does not get mad or upset with anna when she came into her room
she feels like she has too much responsibilty in helping the family yet feels like she must help
one trait that describes rose is the way she supresses her true feelings
rose fears that tis may dissapoint her aunt and her mother
she feels weighed down from all of her responsibilites and doesnt think that all of this is necessary
rose has a tendency to not let others know how she is really feeling
instead of voicing her doubts she laughs in an attempt to brighten the situation
rose believes this because if she helps paul finish school then she is putting her foot through the door
shes a very busy girl and tries to get tasks done
rose is just do down and depressed with her whole life
the walls of her room were bathed in pale sunlight
i mean thats hard on a teen and depressing

in the story rose kept nodding to aunt kolab
instead of saying anything she just nodded and her aunt already understood
she dont pay attention too anna and anna dont pay attention too her
she feels very stressed about the burden she has on her
she has a job a threethousand word essay to do and a little sister to worry about
one of the main characteristics that appears in the story is burdened
rose see it as family is way more important than anything

a triat of roses is that she is a queit person
in both conversations rose didnt say much
in the conversation with her aunt kolab rose kept nodding rather than speaking
when anna says money isnt everything rose responds with only if you already ahve everything
they are try to see if rose is having too much work for her to handly by herself
in the story her little sister says money isnt everything
rose responds to that by saying only if you already have everything
this shows that rose has in a way given up
she seems like an optimist because she doesnt get angry about her dad like anna does
aunt kolab can see that rose feels weighed down by what she is doing to help her family
rose is a girl who seemed to always be stressed out
she freaks out an anna which kinda gives it away
doesnt want to hurt anybody if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
and probably her aunt would tell her mother
rose ithinks money is everything and that she needs to have it
stressed out because she has to help out her family and do her school work

most of the stress is caused by her parents but her brother is also a contributing stress factor

when talking to aunt kolab the author states rose kept nodding
thhey all have regrets in life about one important thing
but her aunts offer had somehow made her feel lighter
rose feels overwhelmed with the burden of responsibility that her family has placed on her
her dream of pauls body weighing her down underwater exemplifies this

rose is curious about her life and if it will ever get easier
rose doesnt care about much of anything else besides herself
she is a very busy but dedicated person

after shed finished her aunt said with a puzzled look

rosa feels like she has far too much responsibility than she should
anna poured two glasses of orange juice and handed one to rose

dragged because of the dream she had the night before that she told her aunt
rose has a positive attitude towards papa being gone
rose felt tha her life would get easier
in her conversation with anna anna is upset because her father is away

but her aunts offer had somehow made her feel lighter
cambodian tradition and sense of family she realized could survive an ocean crossing

as rose listened to her aunts suggestions she calmly nodded her head in agreement to her aunt
one trait that can describe rose is stress

to rose other peoples feelings matter more
one trait to describe rose would be pressured
her job family and a threethousandword essay are occuping her time

rose did not complain so i would say she is patient
why is that because the story says she felt to young for so much responsibility
anna is stuggling hoping her life would get easer
she is very unopen with how she really feels to the rest of the family
even though she is struggling with everything she tries to make them see positive
rose wants to please the people in her family
i believe that rose is overwhelmed by having to go to school and work
in the story rose changes the subject when anna reveals that she had had a bad dream
this shows me that rose is too concerned about her own problems
one tof many traits rose has is selfishness
rose knows deep down the troubles and problems she has most people have also
but rose makes it seem like she only cares about herself
her trait is that she can see things form anothers point of view

i fell asleep working on my essay rose said
in roses dream she feels her brother is crashing down on her and she cant get away
do you feel weighed down by what your doing to help this family
this shows that rose does a lot of work to help out around their home
shes worried because she has to write a three thousand word essay

not once does rose express her worry about the situation
aunt kolab making muted noises in the kitchen
one trait that can describe rose is that she is jelous of paul
an example is when she says we have our part to do to help paul finish college
from reading this story i have come to find that rose is a selfcentered person
in both conversations they talk about being flustrated and weighed down with stress
rosa feels that she is too young for so much responsibility
she didnt want to make a mistake that could result in someone being mad at her
one passage in the story that would support this conclusion is rose didnt answer

that her mother is always late when getting home from work
a detail from the story is we have our part to do to help paul finish college
she shows this trait in her conversation with anna
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother
she wants to find something better for her aunt and whole family not just one person
rose is not a selfish person which makes her trait outgoing
from paragraph i could tell that rose is a very modest person
i got the feeling that she doesnt like to bother people
she even says if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
therefore she clearly does not want to burden anyone
rose is always busy and doesnt feel like she should be doing all that she does at her age
feeling the family is on her shoulders as if she is the one holding everybody together
pauls body sank down on top of rose pushing her to the sandy bottom
she was unable to breath because of the pressure she gets from her entire family
while conversing with aunt kolab she was very weary about letting her true feeling show
aunt kolab thought up the meaning of roses dream and asked if rose felt that way
of course rose not wanting any help or pity avoided expressing her true emotions

she was afaird she was afaird to tell her aunt the truth
rose is brave in the sense that she doesnt want her sister to know how she really feels

when in reality he was gone for four months
which is found in paragraph sentence

rose seems like she is a very smart girl
she is writing an essay for the state competition
if she wasnt very smart she wouldnt be writing for a state competition
she gives off a very exhausting vibe about her extremely busy schedule
like in the storyshe did not talk one bit to aunt kolab at all she only nodded
rose needs to say wats on her mind or her life will be pushed around
rose tends to feel uncomfortable with expressing her inner struggles
she just wanted a better life for her family in the united states now
when anna asked her what she feeling okay
she told her she was fine even though she wasnt
rose is under pressure from all the work she has to complete
rose feels that she cant squeeze in one other thing into her schedule
aunt kolab is very understanding of people and realizes what is going on between rose and her family
when rose comes out into the kitchen looking sad aunt kolab knows exactly why
one trait is that she is really nice she said as gently as she could
that she hate sthat her dad is gone to work in las angelas
when rose looks at her situation at a different point of view
it finally occurrs to her that she can write her essay over her life style
she doesnt want to appear vulnerable or weak so she doesnt share her true feelings with anna
rose is a person thet tries to keep her family together through rough times
one of roses traits is the she is resourceful
her aunt promises to sell treats and sew for people to help
she works hard at school and she helps out her family
she shows that she cares for her sister
rose feels conficted by how she believes that no one really understands what she is going through
she is very down to earth and knows that her mom has to do what she has to do
anna rolled her eyes and shoved her chair away from the table
one trait that best decribes rose is that she keeps to herself
meaning that she holds her feelings inside and does not share with anyone
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
this is and example from the story as to the trait i described
she is confused and busy with her life is right now
she was talking to anna and said he had to go
los angeles paid three times what he was making here
that she was under stress and her mother was working late
that rose knows wgat is going on with her family
she is a person who thinks bout every thing even if it is a old thought
hard headed but open minded at the same time
rose is a person who tries to please everyone
when she is quiet she seems self concious
rose comes off to be a an impatient person
its not her sisters fault that she has to write such a long essay
in paragraph she puts this theory into effect
how she was turthful she told her aunt about her dream
also she kept in about how she felt about the work load
i believe that rose had the trait to endure
not only does she endure her long hard days and make time to write her state qualifying essay
rose doesnt think that her life will never get alittle easier
unless her parents and her aunt had someway to make her feel lighter then always being busy
camdodian tradition and snese of family she realized could survive an ocean corssing
rose is not very happy that her father had to go away for his job
when she wakes for her bad dream she goes to talk to anna about how she feels
rose doesnt understand that so she is very upset about him leaving
like in the story her aunt said this must be difficult for you
that rite there is what tells me that rose feels responsible
she feels stressed like she cant do what she wants to do
she said that she couldnt go because shed missed too many shifts and she needed her job
one trait that describes rose is tired exhausted
i feel asleep working on my essay rose said
anna feels sorry for her dad cause her mom works way to much
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
she worries too much about her future instead of what is happening to her right now
she talked to anna about they had a part to do so that they could go to college
aunt kolab also asked her if she felt weighed down by what she had to do
she is lonely and dont like having her parents not around
rose has identified her self as stressed
durring both conversations rose seems to be hiding it
when roses aunt began speaking she noticed roses face
do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family
that their father left to make more money
she feels like she isnt ready to have someone elses fate in her hands
she feels like the wolrd is resting on her shoulders
from reading the passage one of roses traits would probably be confusion or exhaustion from the essay
she has so much to do in so little time
she has to do that paper and also put someone through school
it seems like hes been gone for years
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
and probably her aunt would tell her mother
it saids that rose didnt answer or she just nodded
when rose talks to her sister they do not get along and they argue about there family and money
when rose talks to her aunt she feels the same way as rose does
they both understand that the family needs money
her aunt says that it was the same way in the other country
they both have the same trait just different arguments
at first rose dislikes all the responsibility that is put on her
then she realizes that paul has the fate of two people in his hands
rose only has to take care of herself for now
she appreciates the fact that paul will care for her and her sister
rose feels as if she has to work work work to help her family
it seems she cant enjoy herself or write her essay
rose said that she feels too young for so much responsibility
she told aunt kolab and she understood
seeing that she would see what she could do to take some stress off of roses shoulders
she wasnt really in to the conversation
she just kept nodding her head to show that she understood what her aunt was trying to say
rose could be described as lazy because she doesnt want to work
rose knows she has to get the essay done and ann i will ing to help
she is easily stressed out to the point where thinking clearlly is near impossible
the dream that she had was symbolic because paul weighed her down just like stress weighed her thoughts
its almost like she is looking for attention
rose is responsibility because she said she felt too young for so much respnsibilt
rose shows this when she is talking to anna
rose does not say much but finally looses patience with anna
rose is a independent teenaged girl with alot on her plate
she feels overlwhemlmed with the familys focus on her brother paul
anna got upset and said money wasnt everything to her
roses trait in independence has been grounded down into nearly nothing
shes more to herself she wont talk about her feelings to others
at the end of the story aunt kolab was asking rose about how she felt about the family
she asked do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family
rose didnt answer to her aunt kolab she just simply nodded
a trait that rose has is the ability to suppress her problems and to reassure others
when rose talks to anna about working on the essay so hard that she fell asleep doing it
she is constantlydoing something to help wether it be school or family
a trait that rose showed when she was talking to anna was that she can be sarcastic
rose is upset because her mother is always working
she feels that it is her job to watch out for her sister and little brother
she is stressed out alot and she cant write her essay
when would she squeeze in writing a flawless threethousandword essay
one trait that describes rose would be stressed
the story also tells me that she would have to squeeze in writing a paper
rosa told her aunt kolab about the dream she had and how she felt about it
i think roses most outstanding trait is her sense of sympathy
rose seems like a young girl with too much responsibility
this also shows a good deal of selflessness and respect for others
what is only one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with anna and aunt kolab
the one and only trait that i think could describe rose is motivation
rose felt that she did a lot for the family
she balanced having a job school helping take care of her sister and family
rose did not answer her because she didnt want her family to feel bad
she thought that her aunt would also tell her mother
she didnt want anyone to feel bad or get mad at her for anything
she wants to fix everything and make sure everything works out
rose can quickly see the better things that can come out of the situations she is living in
thinks she knows everythingshe ignores anna
rose shows this when she stops by her mothers bedroom and finds her mom asleep
rose thought she is to young to have all the responsability that she has to take care of
and is streed by it all and she still has to wright aflawless threethousandwors essay
do you feel so weighed down by what youre doing to help this family
she tries to do her best to keep the family going
when anna is complaining about her father rose soothes her being as gentle as possible
rose hides her emotions for the sake of others
happy cause she trys to cheer her sister up
she is scared and dont know what to do she feels alone
a person that trying to be sucsecfule and dowhat her eldors tell her to do
in cambodia our first country what were all doing would be quite normal
he then realized he needed to learn to read and try his best to achieve his own greatness
he is excited because he will learn how to and be good at a sport
he also found out that he broke records
paul remembered that he can read and that he can help him
mr leonard has poor reading skills and therfore had to drop out of college
he was an amazing athlete who lost his scholarchip
paul became an amazing athlete who cant read as well
in paragraphs he gets stopped by mr leonard and then trains more and improves during paragraphs
paul and mrleonard both have poor reading skills but are great athletes
mr leonard was a very good track runner
he broke lots of records while he ran the hurdles
he was a poor reader and lost all his scholarships and flunked out of college
paul is going to help mr leonard read and mr leonard is going to help paul run track
mr leonard was ashamed although he did well in his athletics he wasnt a good student
and he wanted paul to know that you cant get by easy without knowing you work
he wanted paul to focus on learning but at the wsame time become a better athlete
mr leonard try to be good person and he want to go to collage but mrleonard felt embarrassment
they find alot out about eachother more and more while mrleaonard is training paul
no school wanted a runner that couldnt read so he never went back
it shows that paul will have a good coach to teach him how to do the hurdles
paul knew nothing about mr leonard before he started having conversations with him
paul didnt want to not learn how to read
also it helped paul realize what kind of person mr leonard use to be
like a good athlete a good person but not the smartest
paul is a natural at the hurdles and soon hes about to join the track team
he was confused and wanted to know why mr leonard didnt tell him about his past
paul was get help from mr leonard when he need help
he wanted to know more because he asks well what happened after that
there is a lot of effect of mr leonards background information

he wanted get away from his fears so that he can move on with his personal life
makes him feel like he knows the person better since they have all that information about him
they didnt have learning places back then
he finds out about his colledge track succes and wants to be like him
paul would have almost the same background as him except pauls would be about high school
paul was worried about his reading dissabilities
when mr leonard finds out paul cant read he helps him get better at hurdles
he does not ussualy stop and talk to him and seems a little nervous around him
it helps paul realize that everyone is good at one thing while another may be harder to accomplish
the backgroung information affected paul by letting him know mr leonard cant read too
this shows paul that he can get better and not give up
it also build his relationship with mr leonard by going to the learning center together
the background information influences paul
it is because of the information that he wants to join the track team
so he tried to live his dream out on paul in a way
in the baxkgroung ionformation it effects paul majorly because he thought that the teacher was great
i believe that paul is changed even more by finding out about mr leonards college life
it shows paul that even if youre bad at education you can still be great at other things
it opens up a new world for paul is what im saying overall
paul is in the same situation as mr leonard
mr leonard is like paul a poor reader
also he sees himself in him by taking him to the track
also he was a poor reader and thats why he flunked out of college
paul ask mr leonard why he kept such a proud accomplishment from him
well this collage student said he want to be an athlete and win lot of matals
it also shows him that he will need to try hard and never give up
the background information effects people because it showed that everybody is good at something in life
mr leonard got backgroung information o paul so he knew a little abut him
he was a hall monitor and he mad sure people were always on tie for class no matter what

paul needs to be concentrated and very smart to try new things
he gets information that mr leonard was a college freshmen who won the meter hurdles at the nationals
mr leonard was a good athlete but not a good student like paul
so his teacher helps him and coaches him

that mr leonard was a really good athlete but he wasnt the greatest student
he didnt have a scholarship and didnt make it threw college
he is concerned about why mr leonard didnt tell him
he goes to a reading program twice a week
the background information mr leonard gets on paul is he can run track
he ran in college and did not tell anyone
the found out when he ran track outside one day
the background information saddens paul because mr leonard never told paul about his background
paul was confused on why he was never told even after all the training
paul feels that mr leonard could have went places but him not knowing how to read stopped him
the background information about mr leonard has an effect on paul

mr leonard goes to college on a scholarship he says they told him he would have tutors
he wants paul to become a good student first
paul was a feshman who was alway pick last he could not ready well
mr leonard has some background on paul he know that paul cant read
he know that something had to happen when he was in gym class
it was hard for him to get on the track team
the effect it has on paul is a good effect because he decides to help mr leonard in the end
the background information that he recieves effects him that a national runner cares about him
and that they arnt too different in the fact that they both cant read very well
like it says in the story no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read
the effect the background information has on paul is confusion
he doesnt know why mr leonard didnt tell him about his past
that mr leonard was a really good track runner
the during is the story reader gets background information because the no they have to do because not more
mr leonard was embarresed about what he did in high school but paul wasnt
he was sad because mr leonard lost his scholarship and flunked out
no other school wanted a runner who could not read
it upsets paul when he hears do to he thought leonard didnt want td
it makes paul quizical as to why a record breaking runner was a hall monitor in his school
pual asks the hall monitor what happend after the event in the picture
but at the end he just wanted paul to be a good person
pauls track coach asked who helped him learn and get so good at hurdles
he also found out about how he couldnt read and fluncked out of collage
through the story paul gets information in his head by adding up details through what mr leonard had said
mr leonard then trys to get paul in a sport to impress the coaches
paul seems sad that mr leonard didnt tell him about his track career that he had in college
since paul told him that he couldnt read he thought mr leonard would tell him about track
the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me
this man had given his time to help me excel at something said paul
suddenly he realized what he could do for him
it kindof makes him worry but he still obeys mr leonard because he has always listened to him
it doesnt really scare him away but it brings up questions and makes him wonder about the teachers past
it also helped him find out what kind of person he really is and what he likes to do
paul finds out that mrleonard has was in track and that he had won in the meter hurdles
mrleonard dose not want paul to know what had happen to him when he was in colloge
mrleonard wants paul to go and try for track and see how paul likes track
all he wanted was to get in the big leads
paul didnt know that mr leonard was good at track and broke records
paul was sad for the caoch because the caoch had to quit running because of his grades
he then learns the truth and is better motivated to continue working and help mr leonard
mr leonard background informatiosn makes paul feel bad for him
so she starts to help them and went from being one of his students to be his trianer
the effect it had was that he got him into sports
he helped paul he wanted to make him do better in life
thats why he was asking so many questions and getting him to come to the gym after school
the effect on paul made him realize that mr leonard knows what he is going through
that is not a very good reader so he went to the learning center
to try to get help with his reading skills cause he really wanted to run track
so he broght up his english class grade and he got torun track
that paul is able to do much more with this kind of help
he is one of the select few of the remedial program
he is proud that mr leanord is going to help him with his reading trouble
it shows me as the reader how pauls life is and what he has to go through
when it shows me that it creates a bond between the character and the reader
not a bad first effort that was terribleyoull do better next time
the background information that paul got from the internet showed that mrleonard use to hurdle
after that it turned out that mrleonard didnt learn how to read either
the informactin that pauls learns about mr leonard is very shocking and confused about him
in paragraph mr leonard ask paul what was his name so paul though that the was rare
and also in paragraph pauls coach told him to go to a track and field website
it effects the story because paul and mr leonard are the same in ways
paul was woundering why he had left college to be a hall monitor
paul read how he broke record at thge college and was the best
then mr leonard told him that he kind of have the same thing as paul he couldnt read
the information he get is about mrlenonard winning a track meet when he was in high school
mrleonard was suspicious about what the narrator was doing
mr leonard going to the learning center
paul might thought that he did not know what he was doing
mr leondard has done well so he trys to teach someone he can pass down too
he kept students in line and out of trouble
he starts workimg out with the track team
background information can actualy help paul
paul feels petrayed becuase he should have told him at the begginning that he was a star
this information on mrleonard makes paul wonder why mrleonard didnt finish college
he goes to the remedial reading program so he can learn to read
the words that mr leonard said were all too familiar to paul
he felt embarrassment when he got called on in class to read out loud
the background of mr leonard is something he himslelf wishes he could change
he is dissapointed that he dropped out of college and was force to quit track
if he keeps working on his english struggles he will become better and better
it is a lesson to make school a priority of track
the coach for the track team tells paul to look up grabowski on the website when he got home
now he is at a high school teaching paul how to run track
mr leonard was a major track star in college
but they found out that he could not read
so he lost his scholarship and he flucked out of college
they did not wanted a kid that could not read
both mr leonard and paul had trouble with reading which caused mr leonard to want to help paul
it made him feel sorry for mr leonard since he lost his scholarship and flunked out of college
the nararator becomes more accepting of his mentor and coach
he feels that he has good support under his feet as he takes the path of the sport
mr leonard wants this boy to graduate college but he dont trust him
mr leonard used to be a track star in college and he also doesnt know how to read
mr leonard was a hall monitor that was is job
mr leonard wants to get him in to sports
both paul and mr leonard are poor readers
mr leonard used to be a great hurdler so he teaches paul how to be a good hurdler
the background information you get in this article really helps you understand the story better
mr leonard was a tough stick to the rules kind of man and this made paul obey him
paul would never question mr leonard or make rude comments because mr leonard was too stern
this shows that he was in charge and always followed the rules
also paul had known mr leonard since he started middle school
he fineds out that mrleonard it really not what he thinks he is
the background information about mr leonard shows paul that he was a former star athlete
that he has trouble with reading and he goes to the distance learning lab everyday
he has talents that he doesnt know he had
paul is not able to read and he is one of a select few in the remedial reading program
mr leonards background is very familiar to paul
mr leonard is more closer to another teachers because he has same experience as paul
the details we receive from reading the story show the reader several things about mr leonard
the first point which is given to us shows us that mrleonard is a strict man
however as the story progresses we continue to show that mrleonard cares about what happens to paul
at the end of the story we see the reason why mr leonard cares about paul
the effects on paul was that he didnt know that mr leonard was like that in collage
and also he found out that he needed to be tutored
the background information has more so of a good effect on paul
so hopefully that put some type of effort into paul
paul cant read and so do to that its hard for him to do his work
so he has bad grades and cant make any school sprots team
mr leonard was a great track athelet when he was in college
there was one problem he also couldnt read
he had broken many records in his college years
he had got kicked out of college becuase he couldnt read
mr leonard had lost all of his scholarships and flucked out
paul was thinking about that could be him
the information makes paul realize that mr leonard needed help with schoolwork to
he found out he was a good hurdeler but couldnt do college work and wanted to help him
that mr leonard want to college and run track and field and that he should coach it
after mr leonard helps paul become a great runner he went and talked to the rack coach
he soon found out that mr leonard was an amazing runner and even got a scholarship for it
paul also learned that without education its hard to keep your dreams alive
if mr leonard would have known to read he could have made even more records to beat
he learns that paul is a good kid that can pick things up quick
so he help him by learning one thing so that he can learn how to read better
both mr leonard and paul were not very good students in school
because mr leonards words were all too familiar to the narriator
he feels sorry for paul for having struggles with reading because my
the background information had a negative effect on paul
paul saw that he was an amazing track runner but now hes just a hall monitor
what happened to his big chance in a good carer
so it kinda gave paul a loss in hope for sucess
he found out that mr lenoard is not doing well in some things
he did not go to college thinking that he would flunk it so that is the reason why
the effect is embarrassment and and sadness
the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me
you can tell this because he asks mr leonard why he he had not ever mentioned it to him
it makes paul ask why mr leonard did not tell him this
because he wamted to learn evreything that was going on with him
because things where different in college and evrything
mrleonard and paul both had something in common they had a hard time reading
mrleonard eased up and let him go through as if he knew what he was talking about
now mrleonard is their track couch and paul is very good now just like mrleonard was
that mr leonard was a collage track super star and he broke records
it had a negative and a postive effect on paul
it makes paul seem more able to read by using an adult who has trouble reading as another example
it also makes paul feel less inferior to mr leonard
it show paul that people aare like him so there is more than a select few
mr leonard was a good athlete but poor student
his college work was harder than high school work so he lost his scolarship and dropped out
he said the coach did not want a runner that could not read
he wants to be like mr leonard and be a track star
mr leonard was a star track runner and a horrible reader too
paul sees that just because you cant do something right you can work hard to overcome any obstacle
no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read
leonard feel s that paul is just like him in ways
it makes him feel discouraged and angry
paul is upset because he cant do something that leonard can do
paul likes to incourage people to do better
mr leonard did a great job when he was on track
but became very discouraged after attending a college and not knowing how to read
he later dropped out because no college wanted a athlete that wasnt able to read
he explained his past to the narrator to show him that he should never give up
paul wants to learn how to run faster for the high school track
mrleonard shows the boy something how to stay and shape
paul could be good at sport than mr leonard
when paul recieved the background information he had questions for mr leonard
paul cant believe that mr leonard was a college tract runner
he wants to know why mr leonard didnt tell him
leonardo was a hall monitor and he keeped the crowed moving at all times
paul learned alot from him and he used that in life
he noticed that he came from being a very good track coach in a different state
when paul recieves background information about mrleonard they become more familiar with eachother
paul has an inferrior and shy complex as he first interacts with mrleonard
he obeys the comands form his hall monitor but there was no relationship formed
when mrleonard introduces himself as a concerned adult paul still looks up to him
as the reader you learn that mr leonard was once a great track star when he was in highschool
knowing this you can see why he wants to help out the young boy in the story
then you also learn that he can not read that well and that he flunked out of collage
that he was a good athlete but not a good student
mr leonard won the meter hurdles at the nationals
during the story paul gets some backround information about mr leonard
paul learns mr leonard was an outstanding athlete but not a good student
as the story continues paul learns that mr leonard could not read and then flunked out of school
mr leonard was very dissappointed in himself and embarassed
it gives you backround information so you can get to understand the characters more to really feel the strory
without some back round information it can make a story hard to follow
paul finds background information on mr leonard from the website
paul pulled the printout of mr leonard when he used to run
paul was a guy who felt neglected and was always picked last and mr leonard picked up on it
he motivated paul to do hurdles and showed him how they are obstacles in life
he also found that he was not good at reading either so he was concerned and wanted to help
the stouy was about paul whns to be the beast
later the narrator found some information about mr leonard as a track player in college
the narrator was curious about what had happened to mr leonard after his broken record as a college freshman
mr leonard sheeplishly told the narrator that he flunked out the college because he couldnt read very well
it makes paul want to know what happened and why he hadnt told him
i think paul might have been upset because he had trust in him
i distinguished myself from the masses by being one of a select few in the remedial reading prgram
paul seems up for a challenge and is ready to start something with leonard
he seems thrilled and excited to join this track team with leaonard and be against him
during the story paul is given a website to look at
and he did not want paul to go through the same things that he had to go through
mr leonard has kind of the same problems as paul
mr lenoard was a good athlete but did poorly in school
he relied on friends to help him get by
mr leonard had problems with reading and fluked out of college because of it
paul was a good athlete but not a good student
it effects the story in ways that mr leonard was a phenomenom
he broke many records and the narator was being trained by a star athlete
that paul didnt really know about sports that well
paul reminded mr leonard about his college days
the background information that paul learns about mr leonard makes mr leonard feel sad and kind of embarrassed
for example the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me
in the beginning of the story paul tells the reader that he can not read
throughtout the story with mr leonards help paul becomes great at track
after paul knew why he flunked out of college he took mr leonard too the learning center
it gives paul more knowledge on mr leonard
it also makes him more confident in letting mr leonard coach him
the effect that the background information has on paul is that
because then he knows why he didnt say just come on it wont hurt you
another reason is thats why he knows he couldnt read his name on the hall pass
also instead of looking at the hall pass he just asked him where he was going
the coach just probably looked at it and pretended to read it
then at the very end he knows he feels sorry for paul
also paul feels sorry for him and tells the coach come on lets go start your training
he wanted to help paul get better at track and field and much better at reading
he wants him to sucess in collage and be great at track and field
when he found that out he wanted to try to set goals like he did
asked him questions every day he stop him in the hall to see his hall pass
mr leonard was once in the same situation as paul was in
it makes paul think how far he has gotten and how much help he recieved
he eneded up telling him that he was in high school and ran track
he finds out that mr lenoard was a track star and that he held a bunch of records
theses are good thigs for paul because he has a coach that knows what he is doing
paul feels embrrassment when mr leonard tells him about his schooling
in the story gifts paul has trouble reading
twice a week he visits mr leonard the hall monitor
after awhile mr leonard asks paul to come out to the track with him and paul does
come to find out the story is the same both have trouble reading
mr leonard was not able to get help and lost his scholarship
paul learns that mr leonard was an amazing athlete when he was younger
he is a bit disappointed that mr leonard never told him about his college track success
in the last paragraph it shows that paul and mr leonard end up switching roles because of the information
he gets information about him when he dont need it so he takes offense to it
back when he was in collage he was a track star
he wasnt very good in school and counted on his friends to help him with his school work
even then the school work was to hard for him
he lost his scholarship and flunked out of school
mr lenonard was a great athlete in track and field
in school he had trouble in reading but he got help from a learning place
then he went to college and aslo got help
he fells bad that his teacher for track lost his scholar ship for not being able to read
he wants to help the kid because he is a good boy
paul is mad that someone checks his hall pass twice a week
i guess paul is a friend that didnt git in so yhen it was his bussness to
paul realizes that mr leonard is trying to help him become great at hurdles
he wanted paul to be able to be mentally and physically well
in highschool lenard was like paul not good at school work but a good athletic guy
he did track and field and was very good at it
mrs leonard didnt want him to go to the reading center
if paul would not have talked to mr leonard about this he maybe would have quit also
paul met mr leonard when i started middle school
that infomation effected paul by feeling that he has been let down
he looks up to mr grabowski and now sees a fall between the two
mr leonard found out paul failed out of college because he could not read
by doing a backgroung check he is helping paul out
that he was happy to find out what happend to himand what happend after school
the author uses many signs of foreshadowing in this story
the foreshadowing lead the reader to assume he is not educated well
the author begins by introducing mr leonard as the hall monitor
mrleonard broke lot of records and won a lot of races
paul is lucky to have a coach like mrleonard
it shows he wants someone like hhimself to achieve things he wasnt able to
he cant read and paul struggles reading
so that could have a huge effect on paul because he doesnt know how to read
